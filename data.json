            "\n\nThe Journal of Sonic Studies\n\u00a0\nAs an object of study, our sonic environment\u00a0seems to be a quite recent discovery (with the exception of music). It is only at the end of the past millennium that more and more books were published on the aural relation living beings have to their environment. However, one of the most important and trailblazing books on sonic studies already appeared in 1977, R. Murray Schafer\u2019s\u00a0The Tuning of the World. As Brandon LaBelle writes, the book marks out \u2018the parameters, delineations, and categories of acoustic experience and its material operations.\u2019 (LaBelle, 2007, 202)\u00a0\nThe main purpose of Murray Schafer\u2019s work was to study the dynamic interaction between the sonic environment, the socio-cultural milieu, and the individual listener as well as the (conscious and unconscious) effects sound has on human behavior. This might be regarded as the purpose of sonic studies in general today and it is also the primary aim of the\u00a0Journal of Sonic Studies (JSS): how can we understand the impact and importance of sound, both on an individual and a general cultural level? JSS\u00a0thus provides a platform for theorists and artists who would like to present relevant work regarding the sonic environment.\n\u00a0\nJSS presents, stimulates, and brings together\u00a0a versatility of possible approaches. That is why it pays attention to the\u00a0sonic design\u00a0of consumer articles (cars, washing machines, coffee-makers) as well as to the influence of hearing on the relation between mother and fetus; to urban noise pollution as well as the use of sonic weapons in war zones; from interventions in public space by sound artists as well as the effects of background music in shopping malls.\n\u00a0\nJSS\u00a0offers the possibility to present new insights into the relation between sonority and (the deconstruction of) identity, the concept of space, the influence of digital technology, urban planning, deafness, etc. It covers both the material production and active consumption of sound (including music, noise and \u201csilence\u201d) and the bio-cultural meaning of sound and listening. In this way, JSS\u00a0contributes to a rethinking of the relation between acoustics and society.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJSS\u00a0advocates multidisciplinary research and is open for knowledge from various fields of study; from history to philosophy, sociology and anthropology; from medical studies to architecture, legal and technical sciences; from ecology to sound art, performance and media studies; etc.\n\u00a0\nThe Journal of Sonic Studies is an Open Access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution.

            "\n\nJournal of Sonic Studies - Call for papers:\u00a0Sonic Materiality\n\n\u00a0\nThe last decade has witnessed what has been characterised as a material turn in the arts and humanities, which has shifted attention from the role played by language and discourse within culture to that of objects, technologies, materials, and non-human organisms and processes. New ways of thinking about materiality prompted by developments in realist philosophy, including new materialism and speculative realism, have raised important questions about the place of the material in arts and culture, nonhuman agency, the relationship between technology and culture, anthropocentrism, and the environment. However, consideration of the sonic has not always been at the forefront of these discussions \u2013 perhaps because sound has been understood to be immaterial or addressed in ontological ways that privilege its sources. In this way materialist approaches to the sonic raise the possibility of rethinking the nature of sound itself, and thereby what is at stake in it.\n\u00a0\nIn this special issue of the Journal of Sonic Studies we will explore how new ways of thinking about materiality might contribute to our understanding of sound, and at the same time how sound might contribute to developing ideas on materiality.\n\u00a0\nThis special issue continues and builds on the journal\u2019s discussion of sonic materiality in its two \u2018Materials of Sound\u2019 special issues edited by Caleb Kelly (2018 and 2019) and focuses on two fundamental questions: what is sound\u2019s materiality and what is sonic materialism?\n\u00a0\nWe welcome proposals for both articles and sound artworks that specifically address the issue of sonic materiality. Proposals may engage with, but are not limited to, the following topics:\n\u00a0\n\u2022 What is sound\u2019s materiality, and what is at stake in a critical engagement with sonic materiality?\n\u2022 How can notions of materiality politicise and historicise thinking about sound?\n\u2022 What are sound\u2019s material dimensions? Do these relate only to the objects, technologies, bodies and organic and inorganic forms of matter that create, preserve or respond to sound? Or are there ways in which sound (as event, energy or change) might be considered material?\n\u2022 What new perspectives on the cultures, technologies, politics and ethics of sound are opened up by a consideration of sound\u2019s materiality?\n\u2022 How do notions of nonhuman agency relate to sound\u2019s materiality? What is at stake in the idea of sonic agency?\n\u2022 In what ways might creative practice in sound represent a form of \u2018material thinking\u2019? How do technological and material processes challenge established forms of creative practice?\n\u2022 What is a sonic object?\n\u2022 If the notion of sonic ecology points to the ways in which sound is situated within environments, what does a consideration of materiality bring to this?\n\u2022 What are the ecological and biopolitical dimensions of sound\u2019s materiality? How might ideas about materiality prompt a reconsideration of the relationship between the human and the nonhuman?\n\u2022 How might sonic materialism function as a form of nonideal theory, through direct engagement with material objects and practices rather than idealized models of sound?\n\u2022 How might a critical engagement with sound address the gap between the philosophical and theoretical approaches to materiality and the experienced materiality of sound and sound-related objects and processes?\n\u2022 How can we create a language of materialism that emerges directly from the materials of sound?\n\u2022 What might sound contribute to the material turn\u2019s shift to objects, technologies, materials and nonhuman organisms and process? How might this relate to the anthropocentrism inherent in what has been termed the \u2018sonic turn\u2019, in which recent discussion of the politics of listening have focused on the human subject.\n\u2022 How might indigenous perspectives on matter and sound challenge and problematise the so-called \u201cnew materialism\u201d?\n\u00a0\nWe would particularly welcome proposals for articles that address these topics from Global South and/or Global Majority perspectives.\n\u00a0\nPlease send your abstract (300 words) and short contributor biography (100 words) to Andy Birtwistle andy.birtwistle@canterbury.ac.uk and Lauren Redhead l.redhead@gold.ac.uk by 30 July 2023\n\n"
