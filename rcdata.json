It brings together a variety of works that include\u00a0: free spontaneous and partly subjective texts (Sketches) inspired by process philosophy; creation (drawing) work that resounds, to various degrees, with or from these textual Sketches; theoretical texts that link philosophy to the creation work; and potential pedagogical outcomes of this process in the form of exercises or projects for students of architecture.\n\u00a0\nThe content revolves around four interconnected and overlapping questions that seek to examine what drawing is, what it can do and how, as well as what this might imply for architecture education. One of the objectives of the research is to explore how drawing can reveal and in-form lived spacetimes ecologically, ecosophically; how it can enable us to see \u2018space\u2019 differently. It therefore brings drawing into site (actual or virtual) and looks at how the qualitative or atmospheric elements that constitute sites themselves can become instigators of drawing. Drawing with light, drawing with sound, drawing with wind, drawing with the the weather or seasons are recurrent in explorations. The human is no longer the sole author of drawing but simply a participant amongst others in a more-than-human practice.\n\nWhat these explorations have revealed as conjunctive of all their processes is the primordiality of air. Air constitutes the medium that animates space and that is animated and made visible through drawing forces. Light moves through it, wind and bodies move it, sound sets it in vibration, and breath is drawn from it to drag the line or utter the word. Air is the space of architecture, a space of fluids, of the in-between; it is a slippery space of immersion, uncertainty and intangibility. It also constitutes, as Luce Irigaray points out, the forces of the world that architecture has always attempted to cut us off from by enclosing, sealing off spaces in vacuums preventing any sensory engagement with the world, by prioritizing visibility. Perhaps then this research asks, can air (space) be made compatible with vision to teach us something of the places we live in?\n\u00a0\nLastly, one can hardly think of architecture without taking into account its relation with drawing. The research-creation therefore always situates itself, directly or indirectly, in the interval between drawing and architecture, probing the transductive potential of one into the other.\u00a0Environmental elements and the body are the co-activating sources of this potential. One may think of the body of the drawer in Arakawa and Gins\u2019 terms, as an \u2018organism-that-persons\u2019\u00a0: \u2018persons that are behavioural subsets of the organisms from which they emanate and out of which they compose themselves as agents of action\u2019.\n\u00a0\nThe various projects are accessed through links on previous pages.

Some of those ways involved movement while others held more of an observational role. When moving, I found that the environment or intent of my movement held a strong influence on how that activity would go. For example, when moving with the prompt of \"truth,\" I found my movements to be fluid, allowing myself to submit to the way my body wanted to move, without any thought or calculation.

The singing voice is a nature\u2019s built-in musical instrument that everyone owns and can make use of without going through the technical difficulties of an instrument. This way musical development can begin for everyone in childhood. According to the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy \u201cthrough unaccompanied singing and active participation a student can begin to acquire skills essential to all musicians: aural perception, musical memory, inner hearing, true intonation and harmonic hearing. Kod\u00e1ly-trained instrumental teachers regard these skills as pre-requisites for instrumental study at every level. Teachers who spend time preparing musical material through singing find that students play successfully and musically.\u201d7\u00a0\nKod\u00e1ly wrote that \u201cour every musical manifestation must be led by an inner conception, hearing and imagination, and this is trained by singing: free singing without any instrument is the true and profound school of musical abilities.\u201d8. This is the reason why Kod\u00e1ly believed that a child should not touch an instrument before having received at least one of singing training; when instrumental training is to be introduced, singing should always continued to be practiced and hopefully never come to an end; \u201cfree hearing and imagination must continue to be developed and solfege courses must accompany instrumental study.\u201d9, as \u201cmusic is the principal subject, the instrument merely first secondary subject.\u201d10.\nThe role of singing is very important: on one side beautiful singing has its own beauty and developing strength but according to the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy it should be used only as a means to strive in the direction of fully efficient musical\u00a0expression.11\nVarious music-psychological investigations have been done on the topic; worth of notice is the work Martienssen has done, demonstrating that \u201capparent hearing can evolve purely on the basis of a vocal cord routine.\u201d12, but at the same time he warns music teachers that many times the \u201cvocal realisation of the inner conception is [\u2026] of no effect at all in realisation on an instrument.\u201d13. This statement seems to be contradicting with his first assumption and the line of thoughts of\u00a0 the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy itself, and for this reason the following disclaimer must be taken in consideration. Singing and playing on an instrument are motorically different, and for this reason it is not only the singing executed for the sake of singing that has an impact on the improvement of the playing, but it is \u201cthe vigorous aural activity which takes place in singing.\u201d14, that with constant practice has an effect on the musical inner hearing abilities of the student on the long term.\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1935349", "style": "left: 56px; top: 182px; width: 835px; height: 631px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 1; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "182px"], "size": ["835px", "631px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nIntroducing the Kod\u00e1ly Philosophy\n\u00a0\nKod\u00e1ly once said that \u201cwe should read music in the same way that an educated adult will read a book: in silence but imagining a sound.\u201d1.\nAccording to Kod\u00e1ly\u2019s own writings and the information provided in the Kod\u00e1lyhub2, I will present a summary of the main points of the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy.\nKod\u00e1ly\u2019s ideas of music education are usually defined by the term Kod\u00e1ly method; other terms used are Kod\u00e1ly philosophy, Kod\u00e1ly principle and Kod\u00e1ly concept. The Kod\u00e1ly method, is actually an imprecise term to define Kod\u00e1ly\u2019s ideas, as Kod\u00e1ly himself did not work out a complete detailed methodological process of teaching music, creating a method per se, but he rather formulated principles that were adapted and elaborated by his followers over time.\u00a0\nKod\u00e1ly\u2019s educational model was thought to target general schooling, as his main objective was to make music accessible to everyone. Kod\u00e1ly considered music to be part of universal human knowledge; he stated that \u201cmusic should belong to everyone\u201d, meaning that \"music is an indispensable part of universal human knowledge.\u201d3. This is why he formulated the slogan:\u00a0\"Let music belong to everyone!\u201d. For this reason it was only natural that music became an indispensable part of school curriculums, being this way accessible to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, if on one side Kod\u00e1ly meant to educate a large audience, on the other hand he worked with and trained highly gifted music students. In one of the speeches that Kod\u00e1ly gave at the Academy of music in Budapest (1953)4, where he was a teacher, he described what the characteristics of a good musician are:\n\nA well-trained ear\nA well-trained intelligence\nA well-trained heart\nA well trained hand\n\n\u00a0\nKod\u00e1ly explained that all these four points should develop together and be always in balance. He also stated that relative solmisation and what he called \u201cthe science of form\u201d and harmony would be able to cover and teach the first two points; to complete the teaching he demanded that a musical experience as varied as possible should be provided; \u201cwithout playing chamber music and singing in choirs, nobody can become a good musician.\u201d5.\u00a0\nA very important aspect in which Kod\u00e1ly philosophy is based is the central role of the voice; Kod\u00e1ly considered the voice as the most natural instrument and one everyone has access to; Kod\u00e1ly believed that singing is a way to live the musical experience in a creative way and an effective mean to develop musicianship skills.\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1935361", "style": "left: 56px; top: 833px; width: 836px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 2; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "833px"], "size": ["836px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nDefinition of musicianship skills\n\nAccording to Dr. Rowely, the term musicianship \u201cexpresses in a nutshell the aim of all our teaching, namely to produce musicians and not mere machines for turning out sound, however, harmonious.\u201d6.\nDr. Rowely highlights and uses many times the words \u201caliveness or awareness\u201d to describe the skills that make a good musician opposed to a \u201cmachine\u201d.

Kod\u00e1ly was first exposed to this technique when he was visiting England; in that period music schools nation-wise were using a movable-do system, invented by Sarah Glover, as part of choral training.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegarding the English solmisation system, Kod\u00e1ly stated that: \u201cIt is generally experienced that countries and schools using solmisation sing more truly. The reason for that is that when giving a note a relative solmisation name, we are automatically defining and implying its function in the tonality.\u201d16.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen approaching this quote I wondered what Kod\u00e1ly meant by singing more truly; according to Dobsz\u00e1y, solmisation \u201cimplants in the pupil the foundations of musical thinking\u201d17; this can be achieved through systematic practice and the application of fully considered methods. Solmisation functions as a mean giving the technical conditions for what is aimed to be achieved as a final goal: gaining awareness and consciousness regarding music. It is when this active understanding is reached, opposed to a passive exposure to the musical experience, that one can perceive and sing music truly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDobsz\u00e1y also stresses the importance of always keeping an eye out to the final goal, which is always at the service of music, and not to get lost in the process of practicing solmisation forgetting the final goal of music making.\u00a0\n\u201cIf someone likes and cultivates the means because of the perfection of the means themselves, the pedagogical art completely loses its significance; instead of vigorous effectiveness what sets off in an endless multiplying process, the various means develop and grow rampant for their own sakes\u2026\u201d18. It is of crucial importance to always be keen on reaching the final goal being of music entering the \u201cheart\u201d of the pupil.\u00a0\nThis means that specific attention should be drawn to the musical material proposed to the students; the melodies taught should be of good quality.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow does relative solmisation work?\nThe help that solmisation brings in relation to the development of the musical thinking deals with fixing the easy tendency to create associations to individual sounds or to individual intervals and melodic figures; \u201cIt provides possibilities for differentiation and denotation, it brings about familiarity with the various sounds, while it mobilises knowledge-areas related to a certain extent to sound perception.\u201d19. In fact, if a sufficiently strong association exists between the syllable and the sound-experience, then the syllable will evoke the sound experience, and at the same time the sound experience will evoke the syllable. Solmisation makes us free in the sense that we are not slaves to intervals anymore.\nTo better understand how relative solmisation serves these purposes, we first need to understand what components are perceived by a listener when listening to a sound; according to Dobsz\u00e1y there are two elements that appear in the perception of a sound:\n\nThe perception of individual notes, or the acoustic side.\u00a0\nThe function of the sound in relation to the other sounds (defined in terms of relation, contrast, dependence, introduction\u2026), or the emotional side.\n\nWhat makes the use of solmisation a profound method in my opinion, is that the sol-fa syllables assimilate from the musical material both the acoustic and the emotional element of the sound and, in turn, the musical material with its two acoustic and emotional components assimilates the sol-fa syllables. The purposes that relative solmisation serves cannot be covered by the theoretical definition of the sound\u2019s tonal function. When singing in solmisation the way we experience the function of the various sounds is active and is effective because we are making music, and internalising the process.\u00a0\nIt is of the utmost importance that a musical approach is used; it is in fact very common and unfortunate that many students are introduced to music theory before even listening or hearing music. \u201cA sound approach to music will base itself on the naive enjoyment of listening, since principles and generalisations must be derived from observation rather than from dehydrated abstractions.\u201d20. It is in fact this acquaintance with music that will stimulate the curiosity of the pupil.\n\nRisks to take care of when teaching solmisation\nAccording to Dobsz\u00e1y there are two risks in the practice and teaching of solmisation:\n\nFix the solmisation of separated intervals, taken out of context. It is important to always encourage and look for melodies that stimulate the pupil to experience the whole harmonic picture and give space to explore the relation between sounds.\nThe danger of mechanical application. Musicality and phrasing should be always favoured when singing.\u00a0\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936680", "style": "left: 56px; top: 3243px; width: 837px; height: 1196px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 4; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "3243px"], "size": ["837px", "1196px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nSound and Notation\nAs music educators Gary McPherson and Alf Gabrielsson explain in their book \u201cThe science and Psychology of Music Performance\u201d, one of the most disputed issues in music pedagogy deals with how and when to teach notation to instrumental players. On one side, most current teaching introduces notation at a very early stage, to avoid having repercussion in the ability of reading proficiency. On the other hand, the proponents of sound before notion\u00a0state that \u201cchildren will have difficulties learning to read notation unless their musical knowledge is sufficiently developed for them to be able to relate the sound of what they can already play with the symbols used to represent them.\u201d21.\u00a0\nMcPherson and Gabrielsson argue that there are different principles that can be used to develop skillset or musicianship basics that children need\u00a0 before they can be introduced to notation and become musically literate.\u00a0\nThe way notation is taught has changed enormously over time; until the mid-nineteenth century musicians were trained to be all-round musicians by \u201cintegrating technique with other aspects of general musicianship22\u201d, through knowledge that was passed aurally from generation to generation. Music was in fact learned by ear, the students were encouraged to improvise, invent their own passages inspired by imitating the teacher\u2019s model. It was with the advent of high speed printing machines in 1818 that people started having access to cheap scores. Technique books were sold and the emphasis shifted \u201cfrom the development of skills in interpretation, improvisation and composition to music as a reproductive art.\u201d23.\u00a0One could argue that this has spiralled until nowadays with musicians all over the world having access to video recordings on the internet. By the end of the 19th century, the focus of the pedagogues started shifting on drill and technical material (scales, rhythms, articulations, finger exercises\u2026). As a consequence, students were taught to read notation in order to develop technical skills from the very first lessons; even today most instrumental books associate fingering with notation instead of fingering with sound.\u00a0\nJohann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746-1827), was one of the first pedagogues who was an advocate of sound before sign. Pestalozzi\u2019s ideas were introduced in North Americas\u2019s school by Joseph H. Naef, who founded an elementary school in 1809 that proposed music lessons as a basic subject; it is interesting to note how this way of thinking is in line with Kod\u00e1ly\u2019s philosophy of music belonging to everyone. In 1830 Naef exposed his \u201cPrinciples of the Pestalozzian System of Music\u201d, which included seven recommendations for teachers24:\n\nTeach sound before symbol.\nObserve by hearing and imitating.\nTeach one thing at a time.\nMaster each step before going on to the next ones.\nGive principles and theory after the practice.\nAnalyze and practice the elements of articulated sound.\nUse children centered approaches with little assistance from the teacher; let the pupil be curious and deduct.\n\nMany pedagogues yet to come were influenced and inspired by Pestalozzi\u2019s philosophy, including Lowel Mason, Suzuki and Kod\u00e1ly.\u00a0\u00a0\nMusic educator James Mainwaring researched the process of acquisition of ear playing skills; his studies led him to the conclusion that in teaching practice too much attention is drawn to technical skills and mechanised memorisation of music from a printed score. He believed that \u201clearning an instrument should proceed from sound to symbol, not from symbol to sound, based on his belief that the development of music literacy should involve processes similar to learning to speak and then read a language.\"25.\nHis concept of musicianship gravitated around the ability to think in sound;\u00a0 Thinking in sound involves an ability to inwardly hear and comprehend notation separately from the act of performance.\u00a0\nThe figure below shows the difference between seeing notation and being able to think in sound, so being able to hear the notation inwardly (symbol to sound to action) in opposition to seeing the notation and react automatically to it (symbol to action to sound).\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936688", "style": "left: 56px; top: 4817px; width: 838px; height: 495px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 6; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "4817px"], "size": ["838px", "495px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nAnother sound before sign advocate is research professor Sloboda, who thought that before learning to read notation, musical sensitivity should be developed because \u201cwithout some musical knowledge a beginner has no expectancies which can be used in reading.\"26.\u00a0\nWhat is to be avoided is to create links between symbol and instrumental fingerings, otherwise players become robots \u201cto whom notation only indicates what fingers to put down rather than what sounds are desired.\u201d27.\u00a0\nThese principles are in line with Kod\u00e1ly\u00a0philosophy: \"playing a music instrument is more than the technical aspects of learning the instrument; it involves learning how to translate an aural image of a piece into acoustic sound. Learning the technique required for playing an instrument is only one part of the process necessary for translating notation into sound. A child\u2019s aural image of the piece of music will dictate how to perform the piece of music.\"28.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAccording to the Kod\u00e1ly principle, pupils should learn how to read and write known rhythms and melodies, sight-read new melodies, and write new songs using stick notation, traditional notation, and staff notation. In the meanwhile they will develop their inner hearing, knowledge of form, and memory skills while enhancing their music literacy skills. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937332", "style": "left: 85px; top: 39px; width: 727px; height: 33px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 7; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["85px", "39px"], "size": ["727px", "33px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1940381", "style": "left: 100px; top: 106px; width: 648px; height: 42px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 8; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["100px", "106px"], "size": ["648px", "42px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nCHAPTER II - THE KOD\u00c1LY PHILOSOPHY\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1962245", "style": "left: 156px; top: 5206px; width: 136px; height: 137px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 1022; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["156px", "5206px"], "size": ["136px", "137px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nBack\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1962155", "style": "left: 556px; top: 5206px; width: 139px; height: 137px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 1021; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["556px", "5206px"], "size": ["139px", "137px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nNext\u00a0\n\n"}], "1936679": [{"id": "tool-1936870", "style": "left: 55px; top: 3107px; width: 837px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 18; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["55px", "3107px"], "size": ["837px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nRelative sol-fa: a systematic connection between solmisation and playing is what ties this method together.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936747", "style": "left: 56px; top: 182px; width: 838px; height: 510px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 1; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "182px"], "size": ["838px", "510px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nIntroduction\n\nIn the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy playing an instrument should be possible only when a solid musical foundation of aural skills and rhythmic sense has been developed. In Kod\u00e1ly\u2019s vision it is not necessary to learn to play an instrument; musical education that does not evolve into instrumental playing, is still meaningful and necessary because the world needs not only skilled instrumentalists but educated listeners as well.\u00a0\nBut when instrumental teaching is introduced, the Kod\u00e1ly concept contributes to comprehensive music making. From the literature it is clear that the played material should be approached first through singing, preferably in solmisation, and then playing.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn an article by Priscilla M. Howard, she states that \u201cthe incorporation of Kod\u00e1ly vocal techniques into instrumental teaching, is a new frontier with potential for limitless creativity and flexibility for the teacher. For the student, it can result in increased knowledge and better musicianship.\u201d29.\nShe also states that nowadays the main problem in music teaching and education lies in the fact that singing and playing are perceived as two separate entities.\nThe basic principles of the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy can and should be integrated in instrumental teaching by creating a link between the inner hearing and the playing through singing. The students should first feel the music in their own minds and bodies, move to it, sing it, write it and as the final step play it.\nSol-fa syllables can be applied in singing, and this will help create a pitch relationship between sounds both when singing and playing.\nRhythm can be tapped and spoken first before being played.\u00a0\nSome Kod\u00e1ly inspired methods have been created for cello and are nowadays used; worth of mention is the Coloustrings method which is the most renowned Kod\u00e1ly inspired cello method in use at the moment.\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936853", "style": "left: 56px; top: 2007px; width: 837px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 9; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "2007px"], "size": ["837px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nOctave harmonics: to let the pupil get to know and explore the whole fingerboard.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936859", "style": "left: 56px; top: 2356px; width: 837px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 12; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "2356px"], "size": ["837px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nNatural harmonics: to develop the first technical skills on the instrument.\u00a0\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936863", "style": "left: 56px; top: 2726px; width: 838px; height: 97px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 15; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "2726px"], "size": ["838px", "97px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nChanges of position: shifting is introduced very early on to teach the child a very relaxed and free handling of the instrument.\u00a0\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936877", "style": "left: 56px; top: 3457px; width: 837px; height: 64px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 21; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "3457px"], "size": ["837px", "64px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nTransposing: the pupil is asked to transpose melodies by ear.

Therefore it is essential that instrumental teaching\u00a0is of the highest quality.\u00a0\nTeaching an instrument should accommodate the desires of the child and meet their needs in such a way that learning music can be compared to learning a language and playing an instrument becomes the voice with which the child can speak and express emotions.\u00a0\n\u201cColourstrings\u00a0is not limited only to teaching manual dexterity movements made by the two hands but tend also to give the whole music as an \u201cart-package\u201d to the child, where the developing of instrumental technique, the musical hearing (with the help of the relative solmisation), understanding (music theory) and the musical emotions occur in equilibrium all the time.\u201d31.\n\u00a0\nOne very interesting feature of the Colourstrings method is the approach to the way notation is presented. Before introducing more complex notation, colours and pictures are used; this aims to create and keep a connection between seeing and hearing.\u00a0\nEach string on the cello is associated with a colour from the very beginning of the book; this way children can read music and play on different strings before standard staff notation is introduced.\u00a0\nFrom the very beginning musical writing and reading is connected; this makes learning deeper and more lasting because while \u201cplaying and reading movements are connected with intellectual process. Playing an instrument thus develops also to an intellectual activity.\u201d32.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1936837", "style": "left: 57px; top: 1575px; width: 839px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["57px", "1575px"], "size": ["839px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nSee below the different techniques that are introduced in the beginning; it is interesting to notice that, compared to older cello methods, these techniques are introduced from the very beginning at the same time.\n\nNumbered pizzicato: to encourage the development of the independence of the fingers of the left hand.

Connecting relative solmisation systematically with playing the instrument enables transposing and transforming the musical material, a regular strategy in the method to enhance also technical flexibility.\nSinging is where it all starts: the first songs to be played are derived from children\u2019s songs, carefully selected and sung in the Colourstrings Kindergarten classes; solmisation syllables are meant to be sung, and the method recommends to sing every song on solmisation before playing it. In addition, there are separate \u2018cantare\u2019 exercises to prepare for a particular tone set.\u201d33.\nRelative solmization functions as a tie to connect all of the technical aspects of the playing to the inner hearing of the child. The pupil hears the sound before having to play it, which promotes the basis for a solid and very good basic intonation.\nNatural harmonics come in help to create the connection between sol-mi and playing. Natural harmonics are very easy to play as they do not require the string to be completely pressed and their intonation is fixed to the tuning of open strings, which means they always sound in tune as long as the instrument in tuned correctly. The Colourstrings method makes in fact use of these natural harmonics so that even a kid who has just picked up the instrument is able to play so-mi melodies on the cello (which are introduced before by singing).\nAnother aspect that the method focuses on is transpoistion. Solmisation serves again as a tie to introduce this new skill. Once you can sing internally a melody and play it on the instrument, you should be able to play the same melody transposed. Since string instruments are tuned in 5th, often melodies can be transposed by moving up or down the fingerboard and keeping the same fingering pattern. The process can be quite mechanic and not conscious if the inner hearing is not trained, but when solmisation has an active role in the kid\u2019s education, it prepares the pupil and develops and active and aware attention of what is happening when transposing. A skilled child will then be able to transpose also when the fingering pattern has to be broken.\u00a0\n\nObservations\nFrom my analysis of the Colourstrings method I have seen that singing is an important part that, with the help of solmisation, functions as a tie to connect the inner hearing to the playing. Children are asked to sing the whole song before they play, or note by note before they play them.\nIn the book there are no exercises written for voice and cello on two staffs.\nThere are exercises that involve playing while beating rhythm, that are written in two staffs. The child is asked to play right hand bow and left hand pizzicato. This method is used to introduce new rhythm figures and put them in relation to the beat.34.\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1940422", "style": "left: 80px; top: 106px; width: 787px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 28; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["80px", "106px"], "size": ["787px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nCHAPTER III - KOD\u00c1LY INSTRUMENTAL TEACHING\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937331", "style": "left: 86px; top: 39px; width: 728px; height: 45px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 27; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["86px", "39px"], "size": ["728px", "45px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\u00a0\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\u00a0\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1962228", "style": "left: 156px; top: 5156px; width: 137px; height: 137px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 10042; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["156px", "5156px"], "size": ["137px", "137px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nBack\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1962162", "style": "left: 556px; top: 5156px; width: 138px; height: 137px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 10041; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["556px", "5156px"], "size": ["138px", "137px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nNext\n\n"}], "1936954": [{"id": "tool-1937061", "style": "left: 55px; top: 4806px; width: 837px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 17; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["55px", "4806px"], "size": ["837px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nOther patterns can be derived: in thumb position\u00a0\n\nBasic thumb position: 0 1 x 2 -> 0 1\u00a0\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937085", "style": "left: 55px; top: 5723px; width: 150px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 23; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["55px", "5723px"], "size": ["150px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\n2 x 3 -> 0 2 x 3\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937092", "style": "left: 55px; top: 6446px; width: 837px; height: 491px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 26; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["55px", "6446px"], "size": ["837px", "491px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nHow to Practice Singing and Playing\n\nBefore singing the melody it is important to sing and be comfortable with motifs related to the specific melodic toneset the exercise is written with.

If music is to become common property and not only the privilege of the few, we shall have to look for new ways.\u201d38.\nMany kids, when they begin playing the cello, look at the fingerings printed on the score and press the associated fingers without being aware of the meaning of the notes they are playing in terms of their melodic and harmonic role. Even though, at the end, the melody played might be correct, the approach is very passive (the player does not know beforehand how a melody is going to sound like by looking at the score).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe cello being a non-fixed intonation instrument, provides more challenges when being asked to sing and play, compared to singing and playing on any fixed intonation instrument, such as the piano.\nPlaying on the cello, requires an active attention to tuning and pitch;\u00a0even though on the cello there are positions, and fingerings, playing a note in the right position with the supposed finger, does not mean that the note is going to be in tune. For this reason singing and playing on the cello, resembles in a way singing and singing with oneself. The feeling of playing the cello, involves similar mental patterns to when we sing a note.\nNevertheless when singing a note you cannot rely on muscular memory or spacial positioning, while on the cello positions and fingering can work as a guideline (which is not enough for playing in tune). \u00a0\nKod\u00e1ly, stresses the importance of introducing the pentatonic pentachord toneset for melodies and songs which can be easily played on the black keys of the piano.\u00a0\n\u201cAlthough the canons using letter notation can be played in any key, it is nevertheless advisable to remain on black keys. The pentatonic scale needs no explanation on the black keys. Introduced later it can only appear as a defective and incomplete formula. Only teachers who have tried beginning to teach on the black keys, and who have used this method over a considerable period of time, are in a position to talk about its results. According to my experience it is much more useful than the usual prolonged stay on the white keys.\u201d39.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI have tried to find different positions on the cello where the pentatonic pentachord (d-r-m-s-l) can be played. I was looking for the \u201cblack keys\u201d of the cello. I have found five main fixede positions on the cello neck where the pentatonic pentachord can be played. When combining singing and playing, the\u00a0fingering pattern can be chosen to best fit the vocal range of the melody.\n\u00a0\n\nUsing the fingering: 1 x 2 4 -> 1 x 2\u00a0(The arrow -> indicates crossing to a higher string; the x indicates and extensions).

This set of natural harmonics, on top of being part of a pentatonic toneset, is fairly easy to play and can be introduced very early in cello teaching. This is due to the fact that the left hand does not need to press down the strings, there are no issues in intonation as natural harmonics are going to be in tune, if the instruments has been tuned properly, and because sound quality is facilitated by the natural resonance of the harmonics.\n\n\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937033", "style": "left: 56px; top: 3877px; width: 837px; height: 359px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 13; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "3877px"], "size": ["837px", "359px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nNote that on the cello, being an instrument tuned in 5ths, it is possible to play the same melodies on different strings always keeping the same fingerings.

Activities addressing the development of musicianship skills, usually work better in groups, while activities addressing the development of instrumental skills usually work better individually. However, some areas are situated at an intermediate level, playing a transitional role between the development of musicianship and instrumental abilities and the educational path provided by training singing and playing lies in this transitional area.\n\u00a0\nThe reason why singing and playing is so important is that it will develop particular skills sets, that will favour the development of deep coordination; coordination is a necessary ability to deal with high levels of instrument playing.\nWhen singing in tune, the student is actively and constantly engaged in identifying the tonal properties involved in each melodic and harmonic function; singing in tune trains awareness of the harmonic and melodic tendencies and characters of a melody. Kod\u00e1ly once said that \u201csinging connected with music and action is a much more ancient, and - at the same time - more complex phenomenon than is a simple song.\u201d For this reason, combining singing (which is already a complicated task) and playing will bring development in control and coordination.\nBeing able to focus not only on the technical difficulties of a certain passage, but on timbre, colour, phrasing and timing will be extremely beneficial to the player; this is possible to achieve only when reaching a high level of coordination and control in the playing, which brings us back to the importance of training singing and playing.\n\nIn the preface for the \u201c44 Two-Parts exercises\u201d, it is stated that some of the works for voice of Kod\u00e1ly are adaptable for instruments. The editor suggests that instead of being sang, the two part exercises could be played by two different players in a duet. He affirms that \u201cin studying these pieces with care the singer (or player), is half-way to being a composer in his own right\u201d because \u201che may appreciate the importance of tonality in music which is tonal by nature and see how by the insertion of certain chromatic notes variety is introduced.\u201d35.\u00a0\nFrom this idea we can actually take one more step forward and, instead of performing the two part exercises by two players, only one player can sing and play at the same time, and still achieve the same objectives.\nThe benefits of practicing two part exercises with two people, singers or players, are the same and even grater when it is one person singing and playing together the two voices; in the preface of \"Fifty nursery songs\"\u00a036, it is stated that the advantages of practicing two part exercises are as follows:\n\u00a0\n\u201c1. A greater independence in singing is established through the need to concentrate on the presentation of one part against another.\u00a0\n2. Intonation and rhythm become more accurate when it is understood that miscalculations in these particulars destroy musical coherence.\n3. Consequent on (1) and (2) the essentials of part-singing are grasped through consistent practical experience, and through the steady discipline imposed by a graded course.\n[\u2026]\n5. When the interplay of separate strands of melody in a musical texture is experienced at first hand the keen student will notice how frequent this is in other music, including that for orchestra, to which he may listen, or in the performance of which he may take part.\u201d.\n\u00a0\nThe editor also encourages individual singers to attempt the pieces proposed as duets with other singers, or players, to emphasise the importance of experiencing the exercises as a two part musical experience. In fact practicing just one voice, becomes ineffective in respect to the points I have exposed above. \u201cThe groups of notes should be examined in respect of tonality, rhythm, and general relationship to each other\u201d.\n\u00a0\nOn how to approach the exercises:\n\n\u201cTempi should be steady [\u2026]. The singer should form the habit of beating the same time patterns as they sing.\u201d\n\"Confidence should not be endangered, so the tone should not be played softer than mf.\u00a0\"\n\"If an error occurs, you should not stop; mistakes can be corrected later. The most important aim should always be the bigger phrase picture.\"\n\n\u00a0\nThe importance of singing canons\nPracticing singing and playing in canons is a very meaningful activity; Kod\u00e1ly affirms that \u201cmusical imagination is more stimulated if two part canons are played from one staff. If the melody is written on two staffs, the child often does not even realise that both hands are playing the same tune, since the simultaneous action predominates. It is of great value if one melody is sung and the other played.\u201d37.\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937023", "style": "left: 57px; top: 3032px; width: 838px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 9; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["57px", "3032px"], "size": ["838px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\nStarting placing the d on a Bb played on the G string, on an Eb played on a C string or on an F played on the D string.

Every new toneset is introduced first with melodies written combining sol-fa syllables with a rhythmic line without the use of the staff. The last part of the book contains examples of music taken from the repertoire, where singing and playing can be practiced together.\u00a0\nAll melodies in this book can be sung using the solmisation system.

I think this is an added value to the exercise because it provides different angles to experience the same musical material.\nThe piece fits the singing range, which stays between a comfortable octave (B to B).\nI have asked the participants to sing in the octave they found more comfortable; this is possible and doesn\u2019t create harmonical problems when combining the playing with singing because of the features of the piece. If the singing would be lower than the cello in other excerpts there might be a problem in the sense that the harmonic role of the two voices would be compromised. I believe this to not be the case in regards to the exercise I presented.\u00a0\n\nThis is the score of the exercise the participants have been provided with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the original score I marked in yellow what has been used as singing material and in red as playing material. I used the musical material between bars 1-12. I have repeated bars 5-12 switching the singing with the playing.\u00a0\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1938284", "style": "left: 55px; top: 3127px; width: 839px; height: 58px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 31; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["55px", "3127px"], "size": ["839px", "58px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nThe following are the instructions the participants were provided with:\nQuestionnaire Template\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937540", "style": "left: 55px; top: 7657px; width: 838px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 25; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["55px", "7657px"], "size": ["838px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\n\n6 people out of 7 mentioned that the main focus in playing is on phrasing. 1 person did not mention phrasing as the main focus point.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937121", "style": "left: 56px; top: 182px; width: 836px; height: 1136px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 1; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "182px"], "size": ["836px", "1136px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nIntroduction\n\nIn the first part of the research I have explained why and in which way singing and playing has an impact on the development of general musicianship skills over a long term-time of constant practice.\nIn my own practice I have noticed signs that lead me to believe that practicing singing and playing is helpful and relevant on the short term as well, when approaching a new piece (especially orchestral parts and chamber music).\nI have been practicing chamber and orchestral music involving singing and playing (playing the cello part and singing the voice of another instrument) and I have found that this way of practicing has helped me in the following ways:\nWhen singing and playing I am focusing on the timbre and sound colours\u00a0I imagine. I have noticed that this helps me enormously to achieve the atmosphere in my actual playing. Singing and playing passages from orchestra or chamber music, forces me to be really aware of what is happening in the orchestra or in the parts the other instruments are playing. I feel having this background knowledge will automatically give more information and context to the isolated cello part. \nI have also noticed that when it comes to playing the passage in the real orchestral or chamber music setting, the passage is internalised in a way that allows me to not only think about the technical difficulties of it, but leaving me room for detaching from technical issues, and focusing my attention on listening, phrasing, colour, timbre and timing.\nI notice that, since singing and playing is a very complicated task, being able to sing and play requires much more effort than just playing. Only playing becomes then an easier task, which allows me to detach from the technical difficulties of the piece and focus on the musical side of it.\nSpecifically I feel that singing and playing has an effect on these parameters:\n\nRelaxation: my relaxation on the instrument improves. When performing passages that I have been working on and transformed into singing and playing exercises, I feel I have more control over what is happening technically when I come back to the playing only, and I henceforth, can let my body go and relax. Physical relaxation is also related to better tone quality.\nRhythm: this is due to the fact that when practicing with singing, the bigger picture is always the most important thing. When a mistake is made, the most important thing is to not stop and go on. When a rhythm mistake happens in a sing and play exercise, the most important thing is to keep the bigger pulse. Since I focus a lot on it when practicing the exercises, I feel like I have trained myself to value the importance of the pulse when performing as well. For instance, I find myself more aware when I am rushing.\nIntonation: practicing the exercises also made me very aware of my intonation throughout my repertoire practice. I feel like my intonation in a piece gets better because singing and playing acts as a way to actively canalise my attention to the intonation. I feel I cannot intonate passively because singing requires me to have a mental image of the sound in my head, so it is a process connected to the inner hearing. In my experience intonation does not get better just because singing is involved, but because intonation when playing, is an active point of focus if singing is involved.\nPhrasing: when coming back to only playing after practicing singing and playing, the phrasing and the musical idea is clearer. Singing helps me shaping the phrase.\nTimbre: I could more easily find right colours and timbres;\u00a0this is because of the physical relaxation when performing, as well as the ability to detach from the technical difficulty of the passage and listen to myself and the general sound of the ensemble, or orchestra and seek the sound I imagine.\nFocus: when playing my focus shifts to the music and not the technical difficulties of the piece.\nContext: singing and playing is a way to better understand the musical context and the different musical roles of different instruments in a specific piece. I feel that singing and playing helps me prepare better and study a passage in context.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "tool-1937232", "style": "left: 56px; top: 3205px; width: 838px; height: 150px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);", "position": ["56px", "3205px"], "size": ["838px", "150px"], "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)", "content": "\nTarget Group\nThe participants are all conservatory students in their bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s or post graduates.
