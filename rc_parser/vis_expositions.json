How can such a transgression of sonic territories contribute to an expanded understanding of one\u2019s own sonic identity? And could this b/lending of identities point to a more ambiguous yet vibrant field of intra-play? Departing from these questions, this project intends to challenge our idea of sonic identity as a personal subject-oriented entity, and consequently investigate how a collaborative sharing of sampled sounds, can contribute to an expanded understanding of the sounds we play and are played by. Individual idiomatic approaches to one\u2019s own instrument are thus interfered as we transgress habitual boundaries for action possibilities and musical imagination. The practice circulates from the duo of Torben Snekkestad and S\u00f8ren Kj\u00e6rgaard toward external collaborators, where the sharing process involves different approaches to audio sampling and mapping, embedding and embodying, listening and playing with each other\u2019s sonic material to a point where authorship, origin, instrument and sonic identity is diffracted."

As a lumbung practice, harvest refers to artistic recordings of discussions and meetings. \r\n\r\nTogether, we set out to explore how migrant and neurodivergent communities are affected by social systems of care and control, and we sought ways to massage the asylum system \u2013 yes, massage, like a real massage \u2013 so that it could become softer and more humane. Bringing together the vision and artistic tools from both organisations, our work became a temporary coalition of dissident bodies.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOrganised in a series of concentric circles and islands, the map revisits the ecosystem of the project and its traces: informal encounters, public conversations, art installations, and two workshop series in Copenhagen and Kassel, reflecting a multitude of voices from artists, collective members, facilitators, activists, publics, and the lumbung community.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration between Trampoline House and Project Art Works was initiated by Carlota Mir and Sara Alberani in the context of documenta fifteen and funded with common resources from the lumbung Collective Pot.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith support from the Danish Arts Foundation and the Italian Council. Publication design: Laura Miguel\u00e1\u00f1ez and Orestis Nikolaidis. Thanks to lumbung inter-lokal, Trampoline House and Project Art Works communities for their generosity and the knowledge shared, which has made this harvest possible."

During this conversation, the editor interweaves the essence of \"Studio Conversations\" with the overarching theme of \"Circulating Practices.\" Through this talk, you'll get an insight into \"Studio Conversations,\" a research project focused on ways of asking contemporary dance artists about the practices, working and knowing happening in their dancing. \"Studio Conversations\u201d was originally intended to be published as an exposition in VIS. In recognition of the project's specific approach, we decided in dialogue with the authors to depart from the conventional exposition format. Instead, we've chosen to present Studio Conversations as a video conversation. This decision stems from our commitment to presenting artistic research in a way that best reflects the purpose of the project and the vision of its creators. The discussion was filmed on Stockholm University of the Arts (SKH) premises at Filmhuset on 29 September 2023."

        "abstract": "D\u00f6d \u00e5t v\u00e4lf\u00e4rdsstaten (Death to the Welfare State) was a theatre performance for actors, dancers, and musicians that dealt with a concern that the welfare system in Sweden was about to be dismantled. To explore this worry political speeches were superimposed with a narrative inspired by George Orwell\u2019s novel Animal Farm to examine how perceptions of welfare in Sweden have changed from the early 1900s to the present. This artistic research exposition elaborates on the process of developing the theatre piece. It unpacks how the relation between discourse and narrative informed the text and music, and how it allowed for a dramaturgical structure that included all the various performative elements and artistic expressions. Furthermore, the exposition discusses how the performance was composed through a collaboration that was characterised by an open-ended dialogue between the artists and how this enabled distributed decision making, as well as artists performing in other ways than they are used to. The exposition explores the open format of Research Catalogue. Through text and video documentation it builds on the dramaturgical structure of the performance itself: an introduction, five parts and an epilogue. The ambition of the exposition has been to make yet another iteration of the performance."

Yet, the experience of being present in the moment a live art work unfolds is \u2013 inevitably \u2013 lost in documentation. Evocations \u2013 towards a poetics of documentation explores non-conventional documentation to evoke imagination, inspired by the fragmentary, concision and absence found in poetry. This exposition passes through early discussions relating documentation to evidence. It looks into contemporary artists who challenge conventional ways to document, and approaches the act of document as bridging. Insisting on the loss and void inherent in documentation, Fernanda Branco's artistic research: environment embodiment \u2013 towards poetic narratives explores the circulatory generative process some non-conventional documentation can have. In the two projects I remember and Traces, the documentation viewer is invited to imagine \u2013 rather than to see \u2013 what occurred.\r\n\r\nPhoto Credit: \r\nPerformance by Fernanda Branco Traces #3.

From those meetings, we laid a structure where we each created our parts of what became the score for \"Living and Lasting\", which we first performed in Oslo and then in Berlin in 2022*. This score is the pivot point of our exposition.\r\n\r\nOur working process includes considerable elements of risk and surprise by alternating between collaborative meetings and individual work. The first time we perform a new piece none of us know exactly what or how the others will present. Along with the audience, we experience portions of the text, movements, and media put together for the first time, without knowing whether the whole thing will coalesce, diverge, or fall apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0(*) In Oslo at the 2022 Nordic Summer University (NSU) and in Berlin at the symposium \u201cWho tells y/our story?\u201d \u200b\u200bby the artistic research project MEMORYWORK (2021-2024)."

        "abstract": "Textorium: Collaborative Writing-Reading with/in Public Space is a language-based artistic research project that explores collaborative score-based approaches to live, situated writing and reading practices, for attending to the experiential aspects of situated embodiment with/in public space. Between 30 May \u2014 4 June 2022, five artist-writers (Emma Cocker, Andrea Coyotzi Borja, Cordula Daus, Vidha Saumya and Lena S\u00e9raphin) met in Vaasa, Finland, to engage in a process of observational and collective score-based writing-reading with/in public space. With its conceptual anchor in Georges Perec\u2019s short book An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris (1975/2010), this enquiry evolves a distinctive approach that foregrounds a corporeal, sensorial and bodily approach to language, where writing and reading are conceived as a collaborative undertaking rather than a solitary endeavour. Working with and through different language-based practices \u2014 including performative, poetic, and phenomenology-oriented approaches \u2014 the research explores the potentiality of emergent spaces (perhaps even of emergent temporalities, subjectivities and collectivities) produced through the interweaving of shared writing and reading practices, as the cyclical rhythms of writing/reading intermingle with the circulating movements, momentums and flows of public space. Through developing and testing various embodied, corporeal, sensorial, and collaborative approaches, this research enquiry advocates the transformative capacity of language-based artistic research for cultivating new \u201cecologies of attention\u201d (Yves Citton, 2017). This shared enquiry explores the critical potentiality of our \u201clinguistic bodies\u201d (Di Paolo, Cuffari, and De Jaegher, 2018) as sites of both resistance and affirmation."

These methodologies propose alternatives for knowledge exchange/production beyond hegemonic, Eurocentric education.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, I reflect on my own practice and the anti-patriarchal and decolonial feminist political basis of the collectives of which I am part. We work with strategies and methodologies inspired by feminisms from the Global South, such as taking care of others as a practice that puts aside the patriarchal capitalist model of life that mainly separates, individualizes, prioritizes, and promotes competition and exploitation. We promote exchange, cooperation, and interdependence. I reflect on how these encounters summon the festive memory of our territories and the resilience of our* wounds.\r\n\r\nEmotions of the bodies and the resistances will trigger our rituals in Abya Yala**, the flows and drifts will make this poetic-affective encounter, as will the skin itself.\r\n___\r\n*We: Here I refer to collectivity in a broad sense in each case: We as the collectives I am part of, we as women (cis, trans, nonbinary), we as immigrants, we as bipoc, etc\r\n**Abya Yala: Self-determined name for the territories in the global south named \"America\" as a result of the colonizing process."

The burning of this theater, along with many others, was the starting point for imposing restrictions on art and culture.\r\nThe research departs contextually from the efforts of the Islamic government to control civil society. It is a reaction to a history of imposing a specific language discourse and discarding elements that represent a non-religious view, visual changes in the urban space and limiting access to specific types of information that refer to citizens\u2019 collective memory.\r\nGiving agency to this theater, the research aims to revive the collective and public memory of a society, being the voice of those that have been silenced for a long time."

        "abstract": "This exposition opens up the memory space of a landscape that carries a collective knowledge of the events of the Second World War in S\u00f8r\u00f8ya, an isolated region far in northern Norway. Inside its landscape voids, the island conceals places that once became a refuge for half of the region\u2019s inhabitants. In this research project, artists ask themselves what collective memory is and how the landscape opens up an alternative public space in its own depths. How do the caves of the island of S\u00f8r\u00f8ya carefully hide and preserve the memory of the events of the Second World War, and how do these events fade into the shadows of Norway\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 social memory?\r\nThis exposition shows one chapter of our ongoing research project Dunke-Dunk, where the landscape is becoming the cavescape and the cavescape is becoming the humanscape through the artists\u2019 long field trips to the region, their bodily immersion in caves, and an endless evagation searching for what preserves the memory of the touch of the Second World War through the [re]reading of archives, all the while collecting stories from the inhabitants and the terrain from an architectural and artistic perspective."

And how can we distort such rituals artistically in order to make them memorable events? As artists, we regard distortion as the process that gives character and distinction to things and situations, as well as something that confuses and enriches information and interpretation. Through examples emerging from the operatic production Chronos\u2019 Bank of Memories (2019\u20132022), set in empty shop stores with interacting visitors, we have recalled and fleshed out issues of rituality with distorted proportions. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, its production was interrupted and later on revived, which affected the work. This exposition covers aspects of both our artistic practice in general and this particular opera\u2019s tendency to encompass distorted rituals. Commentary texts, images, and audio/video clips are arranged into an introduction and then three thematic strands in order to offer a reasoned overview of our work process."

Not only today but when the camp was still in use by the Nazis. How could people carry on living so nearby? He subsequently transformed the memories of his personal encounters, experiences and observations both in the camp and in the village into a book, which he, in turn, transformed into a sound work and, finally, into a film. In this exposition, Bok explores what became specific to, and distinctive about, each of the three different expressions or works \u2014 in other words, which narrative components remained, which disappeared, and which were added."

How do they interact with a landscape, what could they want to protect and where do they mark their boundary lines? Drawing from the ancient stories of Rakhandars, mythic beings that guard or protect Goan villages, this collaborative process weaves personal stories with the land and history of Goa. Altodi Poltodi began as a conversation between two friends on a bridge over a river, in a state of suspension, connecting two shores \u2013 those of memory and the present."

        "abstract": "Through experimental writing and conceptual photography, my PhD uses my own biography to investigate the consequences of societal transformation processes in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The focus is on the period of regime change known as the \u00bbWendezeit\u00ab in the late 1980's to the early 1990's in East Germany. To date, this subject has been analysed primarily by scholars of history and cultural sciences, while approaches to this topic by artistic researchers are still rare.\r\nWith my research, I would like to reveal causes for the outbreaks of violence that accompanied this radical shift. The objective of my PhD is thus to submit critical testimony to the silence about seldom-discussed side effects of the transformation during and after the turnaround which Germans call the \u00bbWende\u00ab. Based on the example of (my own) individual history, it demonstrates how authoritarian regimes and structures impacted on three generations of citizens, and how they affected the individuals. Throughout an experimental narrative, outbreaks ofsenseless violence are treated as side effects of disruptive transformation processes, just as are ambivalent situations in which actors of social change recognise themselves to be simultaneously victims and perpetrators of violent incidents. Since personal memories and historical documents served as the basis of this work, the central challenge of my artistic research was to carve out generalisable elements from individual examples, and to try out and experiment with various textual and photographic formats to find an adequate way to present the research material. Important sources of inspiration for this process included works like Alexander Kluge\u2019s \u00bbLebensl\u00e4ufe\u00ab (\u2018Case Histories\u2019), Primo Levi\u2019s \u00bbIst das ein Mensch?\u00ab (\u2018If This Is a Man\u2019), Walter Benjamin\u2019s \u00bbDenkbilder\u00ab [Thought-Images], Klaus Theweleit\u2019s \u00bbM\u00e4nnerphantasien (\u2018Male Fantasies\u2019), Georges Didi-Huberman\u2019s \u00bbBilder trotz allem\u00ab (\u2018Images in Spite of All\u2019), Claude Lanzman\u2019s documentary film \u00bbShoah\u00ab, and W.G. Sebald\u2019s novel \u00bbAusterlitz\u00ab. The result of my research is an experimental book that portrays the multidimensional nature, polyphony and complexity of the subject, and offers the readers an opportunity to deal with the material in the way they desire, and perhaps to make it useful for their own work and research."

        "abstract": "This research is part of my doctoral project Archetypes of Contamination, which focuses on the relationship between symbolic images and processes of environmental transformation. This exposition, Tree of Dawn, develops by looking for the correspondence between radioactive contamination and the traditional Latvian image of the Sun-Tree as found in the Dainas, an ancient form of poetry transmitted orally through songs. My artistic process uses a re-creation and re-interpretation of ritualistic practices. With a focus on radioactive contamination, my research looks at how the experience of contaminated spaces can be read through specific myths connected to the land to interfere with the creation of personal and collective realities. The exposition moves through methods of translation as a way of reflecting on the limits of knowledge, where translation is thought of in the wider senses of transposition, deciphering, decoding, and reading through."

Placing a dancing body in center of the research gives rise to the position which yields the required perspectives. When dancing, the stance of representing a genre is assumed, taken and given in a concrete way, in this case \u2013 folkdance within contemporary contexts. Moving in circles through references from different discourses, and by allowing these circles to intersect in practice, the work achieves its critical point of view."

        "abstract": "Circular Bowing, Cyclical Work explores the collaboration between composer Henrik Strindberg and myself, violinist Karin Hellqvist, from my viewpoint as performer and co-creator. On my initiative, as part of my PhD in artistic research at the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo, a cyclical collaborative practice is being developed. Our process differs from the conventional separation of roles that I have so far experienced as a performer of contemporary Western classical music. The exposition highlights how my understanding of the emerging concept of 'the artistic palette' develops through the shared work and dialogue around Cirkul\u00e4ra Str\u00e5k for violin and electronics, when expanding my practice and establishing a new work mode. Through examples from the artistic process, the exposition aims at further unfolding how we as collaborators develop ways of challenging each other. A keyword for my defiance of the traditional and formal task division, is the search for connection \u2013 connection to my collaborator, the work, and the embodied knowledge of my artistic palette. The exposition comprises written reflections, transcribed dialogue and sketches as well as video and audio documentation. Documentary video conversations are held in Swedish with English subtitles."

        "abstract": "Back to Present discusses the themes, filming structure, and editing process of the short film A Day Becomes (2018). The film is part of Guava, a platform for art-actions that promotes the idea of free movement and the removal of borders east of the Mediterranean. In this exposition and in making the film, I explore the possibilities of political imagination regarding regional movement across borders in relation to the phenomenon of Time. \r\nThe exposition has two parts. The first, entitled Here, unfolds around discussion about the landscape; the second, called Now, suggests that how time is experienced can affect how one experiences one\u2019s surroundings. The form of the texts correlates to the content, form, and making of the film. The film making text is set in the center of the exposition, and the other discussions push themselves in and spread over the page. Like the text, the film\u2019s continuous timeline is dense and loaded with plural repetitions and conversations. The interlaced reflections and commentaries that characterize the text echo Yousef\u2019s layered performance of time in the film.\r\nWith its layout and content, the exposition explores the film\u2019s structure and embodied experience of the landscape through time: it is a way to rethink and re-feel the Here of this region through the lingering Now of the film.\r\n\r\nThis exposition was developed from my PhD thesis at the PhDArts program, Leiden University"

Begun in 2011, the point of departure here is a particular moment in the unfolding of the project: the recent completion of the final D-word, \u201cdystopia\u201d. A to Z is premised upon the carrying out of a defined conceptual rule: a \u201ctactically absurd\u201d commitment to a lifetime of artistic effort, whose ostensible folly gives rise to an ever-expanding body of work that appears arbitrary, unwarranted, and nonsensical, but which, through its playful insistence, might also be understood as operating in a new and alternative realm of sense."

        "abstract": "This collaborative and cross-sectoral project addresses places, environments and spaces beyond mere functional urban endeavors. The project explores possibilities that become visible when public space is viewed from perspectives beyond the urban norm. The aim is to restore lost rural relations and to search for ways to leave the anthropocentric narrative. In the past, densification of cities has been considered synonymous with sustainable development, creativity and innovation. However, a one-sided urban focus leads to disarmament of rural habitats, and dissociation from human interdependence with non-human nature. Today, adaptation to global warming is dependent on the survival of the rural. Therefore, this artistic research project is primarily informed by activities in rural environments together with species and ecologies other than human and urban. The goal is to investigate how art, design and architectural interventions can foster oppositional narratives to anthropocentricity. What I present in this exposition are my most recent collaborations and a journey of professional metamorphosis to reach this goal. The result is a series of ongoing projects and processes that demonstrate how I explore places of communality, togetherness and mutual beneficial interdependency between species."

Processing the mental and ideological undercurrents in Europe, the text describes a trajectory where the visual artist appropriates the role of a poet to explore the possibilities for change and movement in isolation. As thinking, reading and writing alters the protagonist, the appropriating artist becomes appropriated by language. The gradual blending with the observed subjects raises questions about the distinction between the internal and external."

        "abstract": "On 30 July 1984, 11 mercury miners locked down in the mines of Almad\u00e9n (Ciudad Real, southern Spain) to protest against their precarious economic and social conditions. 650 metres deep inside the oldest and most productive mercury mines in world history, the miners endured the dark and contaminated galleries for 11 days and nights until their claims were addressed. As an emigrated local filmmaker, I come back to post-industrial Almad\u00e9n in 2019 to make a documentary film about the mining strike. The premise is to find young locals willing to live inside the now-closed mines for 11 whole days in homage to the older miners and to recreate the experience of 1984, 35 years later. Apart from engaging our collective mining past, performing the form and duration of a previous workers strike, Encierro proposes the underground as a living and symbolic space to foster a series of conversations, encounters, and social and political propositions to reimagine Almad\u00e9n, which rose from a mine shaft more than 2000 years ago, as \u2018something else besides\u2019 a mining town.\r\n\r\nThis exposition explores the potential of documentary film fieldwork to take on a different relationship to normal life that the same or similar events would have as \u2018untransformed reality\u2019 \u2013 a strike versus the reenactment of a strike \u2013 and its potential for activism and social transformation. I will also explore the use of the conditional tense in documentary; a speculative and hypothetical approach to reality sensitive to the \u2018potentially\u2019 real, the \u2018possible\u2019, and the \u2018what if\u2019 as modes of documentation. What happens when the forms of \u2018documentary\u2019 and \u2018reenactment\u2019 are exceeded, and act upon the world rather than only represent it?"

        "abstract": "This research is working with Sonified Textile Controllers. They can be described as textile sensor-based tangible interfaces. Some of them are part of a disruptive sound performance \u2013 an experimental sound art concert that has been presented in various cities in Europe and the Americas called \"Text(il)ura\"[1]. The three fiber-based controllers presented as part of this performance, The Shipibo Conibo-Style Textile, The Hanap Pacha Quipu, and the Unku\u00f1a of Noise, all reference the cultures of Paola Torres Nunez del Prado\u2019s country of origin, Per\u00fa. These textile artifacts are works of art as well as devices that fall within the scope of smart textiles and that of human-computer interaction, as they allow the user to experiment with alternative ways of approaching the execution of sound art or electronic music. Referring to both aesthetically and symbolically distinct forms of expression from diverse human communities, these cross-cultural devices are characteristically hybrid and ever-changing: history, myth, craft and technology, gender, transhumanism, sound, visuals and tactility \u2013 everything is intertwined in an amalgamation of human knowledges and experiences aiming for a type of universality that does not impose one thought system over the other. The design of the interfaces proposes a different approach to tactile manipulation of electronic sound instruments, where it is common to find controllers made of metal or plastic, and where the aural and tactile sensitivity with which they are first made, transforms the performance itself. The Sonified Textiles aim to redefine musical interfaces, both conceptually and design-wise within the e-textile realm. The research uses a phenomenological framework to go beyond the mind-body dualism and to reconnect with the natural world."

To what extent does the church as a social and architectural environment, shape human conceptions of bodies? What might the history of theology and of the Christian church tell humans about our relationship to our own bodies? The pandemic has put the above questions in a new light: It made the skin a potential carrier of life-threatening infections. At the same time, we suffered the lack of mutual human touch and of physical presence. Caught between the fear of being infected by touch and a hunger for being touched, the project \u201dKroppsliturgiske eksperimenter\u201d appears both challenging and attractive. Crisis has produced a desire for new forms of touch, in art and in human life. This contribution to VIS was created in collaboration and dialogue with performer Hanna Barfod, priest, professional singer and research fellow Mathias Gillebo, film photographer and editor Mats Christian Rude Halvorsen and priest Arne Jor."

I explore how it may transform, \u201cinfect\u201d or enter into symbiotic relationships, that are linguistic, visual, and trans-material in the spirit of Karen Barad. The aim of my work is to offer an outline of what I refer to as a dark enlightenment, by using the ontological and epistemological discourses that humans are entangled in. This text is a manuscript for a performance lecture about bats, viruses, and dark matter, illuminated by a Corona inside Plato\u2019s cave. Similar to and in contrast with the microscopic size of the virus, the pandemic is not here understood as the ultimate disaster, but rather as a footnote in a much vaster narrative that involves a manifold of associated phenomena, related to Timothy Morton\u2019s hyperobject. From the view point of speculative realism, object-oriented ontology, and hauntology, the virus may be capable of hiding future consequences that dwell in our darkened contemporary world. In short, the manuscript may be understood as a contribution to the dark microhistory of an infection. The current version of my work was adapted for online publication, with visual elements of composition."

Initially they are compared to my long-term practice of making abstract drawings patterned on language, and then they are used to theorize a \"poetics of transmission.\" This framework is discussed in relation both to how the virus is transmitted and to how ideas are created and circulated. Various analytical interpretations of the drawings are considered. At some moments, I treat dots in the drawings like ideas or virus particles; at other moments, the strategies I use for connecting the dots represent the process of generating ideas. The drawings become tools for the \"research\" of thinking through physical and intellectual contagion."

Unusually mild winters caused larvae numbers to explode, and extreme drought weakened the otherwise more resilient trees. Expanding patches of dead forest can be found from the North Sea coast to the Baltics. The cleared forest became The Plot: a witness to climate change, and a gateway to dealing with ecological grief. My own eco-anxiety is utilized as a case study: how to deal with this new kind of loss? What is The Plot telling us? How do we move forward without losing hope? The exposition presents The Plot as fertile ground for artistic and collaborative research, including a contribution by Lisa Jeannin, a custom made font, moving image, and an audio work."

In a time when bodies must be kept at several meters distance, what comes of works which explicitly call for closeness, physical contact, and sharing? How might these works be interpreted differently in light of the COVID-19 pandemic? Percussionist and performer Jennifer Torrence reflects on the impact of the pandemic on her artistic practice and on her research as part of the project entitled Performing Precarity, which seeks to explore the inherent risks in performance when musicians and audiences are entangled in codependent structures. In light of COVID-19, this exposition attempts to unfold and trace modes of vulnerability in contemporary music performance\u2014from human contact via eye contact and physical touch, to the precarious negotiation of shared space\u2014and to reflect on how such encounters might breed new understandings and knowledge."

        "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic of early 2020 has had a huge and wide-reaching effect. My group made up of four composer-performers called Bastard Assignments was not exempt. We were pulled to continue to make work, the difference now is that we are online at our individual homes and meeting each other on Zoom. Zoom is a company that has been around since 2011 and a lot of us have recently become familiar with it to celebrate birthdays at a distance, catch up with friends, or conduct our business. It was set up by a Chinese computer scientist who only after the ninth attempt at the application secured his visa to live in the USA. Since the beginning of 2020, the worldwide usage of Zoom has risen 67%, its use diversifying from corporate communications to domestic and arts activities. My compositional and performance work with Bastard Assignments is rooted in collaboration, devising, and group creation. It favours memorisation over the use of musical scores, emotional presence over reproducibility. As we take our work together into a purely online workspace, important questions arise. Through a new way of working online, does our adaptability bring about a new form? How will we understand this online work when and if normalcy returns? Skills that we learn as composer-performers are dropped, remade, and tested during this period, how will our practice have changed?"

I focus my research on the two modernist buildings of E1027 and Villa Mu\u0308ller and the architects behind them. Through the production of these works I have been concerned with how narratives about these houses have been constructed and re-told \u2013 and how these narratives have changed as they have been 'rehearsed'. I have applied the methodology of rehearsal to my process in order to outline how historical writings and archival research can be used with the aim of finding alternative outcomes to what has already been written and said."

        "abstract": "The courtyard, laundry room, and areas for beating carpets are collective facilities in the private sphere of the home. In Stockholm you can find carpet hangers in connection to many apartment blocks even though they are very seldom used nowadays. The act of whipping carpets is an act that aims to get rid of the dirt \u2013 the remnants of life. Cleaning is a repetitive work, where something needs to be done over and over again without it producing something new.\r\n\r\nThe project\u00a0Piskan st\u00e4llningen\u00a0consists of an essay, sound pieces, and sketches in different materials and is divided into three parts; the one who beats, the beater itself, and that which constitutes a stand for the beating. The various associations to the\u00a0carpet hanger\u00a0and the\u00a0carpet beater\u00a0form the basis of the project that centres around questions concerning repetition and productivity, place and time, the boundary between the public and the domestic sphere, and how dangerous the pursuit of alleged purity, hygiene, science, and light can be.\u00a0Through text, sound and images, personal and collective memories, and the object's associations regarding reproductive labour, city planning, violence, the welfare project, and childish games are intertwined.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe material also contains other associations to control and power \u2013 with the whip as a means of threat and punishment, and an exploration of different forms of emptiness in relation to architecture, social structures, and mental space.\u00a0Through a younger and an elderly woman's narrative voice, we follow an associative thought chain that interweaves the public, the domestic, and a bodily sphere. The setting is a society where she comes home from work to yet another form of monotonous routines, where cars get burned down, and tables are placed under vases, whilst someone has been digging a hole down in the city.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThrough sketches in different materials, I approach the carpet beater by exploring its shape. My attempts to repeat the knots lead to a series of variations on the memory of whips where mistakes constitute the basis of new forms.\u00a0In the project repetition and variations in sound, text, and drawing becomes another way of approaching repetitive work"

The essays include reflections on landscape, natural resources, species and gender relations, indigenous cultures and media materiality.  The essays combine images and voice-over, more specifically a series of drawings of still images from existing film footage combined with fragmentary reflections on the images as media inscription and representation.\r\nThe essays are media transformations of existing Swedish documentary films from the peak of the classical era, namely from the late 1930s until the early 1950s. In an ecological context, this period represents what is labeled \u2018the great acceleration\u2019, an increased exploitation of natural resources, and to some extent an intensified separation of nature and human activities."

This bilingual exposition discusses repetition and difference while performing with trees, and uses as an example the video Year of the Pig with a Tatarian Maple performed in Nobelparken in Stockholm during 2019 as part of the project Performing with Plants at Stockholm University of the Arts. The exposition consists of a brief version of the video, documentation of the working process, and an essay with references. The aim is to show how  repetition produces small (and big) differences and therefore makes a difference. And how it in this case led to a new project, Meetings with Remarkable and Unremarkable Trees."

According to the spatial characteristics of the given performance space, this repetition of the performer may be frontal / two dimensional, or may extend across several surfaces, creating a surround projection in which the live performer is contained."

        "abstract": "This exploratory essay introduces selected sound recordings along with notes and observations from Minuting \u2013 a practice of sonic journaling I have performed daily since July 2010 in numerous locations and settings. I weave these observations together in a way that resonates closely with the idea of repetition, in multiple forms: protest, automation, cycle, and ritual, as well as the repetition inherent to my acts of recording. While introducing sounds from the archive of Minuting, I reflect on how this constrained and systematically enacted form of listening, recording, and re-listening leads to a transversal type of sonic reflexivity. It is a form of alertness to sound that stretches beyond the immediate resonance of the 'now' \u2013 towards spatially and temporarily distant, yet to some extent intertwined, objects, subjects, events, and environments. The text evolves across three interrelated layers: annotated recordings from the project's archive, a set of thoughts and associations triggered by re-listening to the material, and a discursive analysis that opens up the project to a dialogue with other thematically resonant debates and practices. Drawing on perspectives from media studies, the philosophy of technology, sound studies and durational art, I discuss Minuting as an art work, a creative constraint and a transversal listening practice. Lastly, I propose it as an existential media technique for composing critical and reflective positions towards one's surrounding space, experience of time, and use of sound technologies."

        "abstract": "In response to digital technology, new methods,\u00a0thinking and aesthetics have emerged that challenge the way we design. In particular, the extraction of movement introduced by motion-capture technology propose a design process wherein the motion rather than the form is used as a material in a design process. In such a process the motion is extracted form a defined set of points that creates a digital representation. In this exposition, the strategies utilized when capturing a motion is translated into the process of garment making with the purpose to challenge bodily aesthetics through dress.\u00a0\r\n\u2028Practically, this exposition builds on two independent studies with the shared aim to define parameters for transformations of the moving body\u2019s expression applied to a garment making process. Yet, the transformation is approached from two perspectives; the first study is non-material and borrows theory and references from the field of dance and motion capturing technology. It maps the body as a point-based system based on the body as a moving form and pin-points body functions that affect these points. This part serves as a foundation for the second study that adds material aspects, in particular, it maps material parameters that relate to how the material is arranged in relation to these points.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn conclusion, strategies of extraction of movement as attachments and the scale of fragmentation of materials are considered the main contribution to the garment making process. As it proposes a new usage of movement, the work has implications for fashion design, costume design but also other body movement-based mediums as it is about the expression of body movement and not just the body as a form."

        "abstract": "A Printing Press of One\u2019s Own (En egen trykkpresse) is a practical examination of the relationship between art and technique, hand and spirit, thought and printing ink. The project came out of an interest in the printed medium in a digital age. Book printing has been the dominant technology for setting and mass reproducing of the printed word from when Gutenberg popularized the technique in the 1450s, and until well into the 20th century. Thon Knutsen set out to search for a professional position which allowed her to combine an artistic approach to typography and graphic form with her technical insight and historical knowledge of book printing. She found Virginia Woolf. The canonised modernist author and the feminist icon worked in parallel with both her writing as artistic practice and as typesetter and printer in her own private printing press. Through in-depth close reading of Woolf's authorship, seen through the first-hand experience as typesetter and printer, Thon Knutsen has found new ways to read Woolf, and a direction for her own artistic and research-based practice. Thon Knutsen has recreated the short story that Woolf printed in her debut, The Mark on the Wall, in its whole, but with a new aesthetic appearance. She has done this with a method that Thon Knutsen claims must have been used by Woolf; the thought and the writing must have been influenced by the experience of setting and printing as a pendulum between the spirit that writes and the hand that sets."

        "abstract": "The mountainous geography of Appalachia has been shaped by the coal industry since the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era of the United States. Mountaintop Removal (MTR) is a controversial and highly destructive surface-mining method flattening the mountains of Appalachian since the 1970s. The rise in massive energy consumption correlated to consumer electronics, automation, and technocratic neoliberalism have irrevocably flattened the surface and culture of Appalachia.\r\n\r\nReclamation is the final act in MTR mining in which the mine operator is obligated to ecologically restore the land. Where MTR sites were once hidden away, and even photographing them is considered an act of trespassing, today I can bear witness to the destruction of the mountain topology by connecting to Google's Earth (not to be confused with earth-Earth). Despite the remote locations and inaccessibility of the sites, the data is particularly rich due to the economical advantages of mapping the region for the coal industry. \r\n\r\nIn this exposition, I make my own reclamation as one in the generation born after the boom of coal production and its inevitable decline. I am reclaiming the 3D geospatial data of MTR and mining disaster sites, extracted from the servers of Google Earth. I recontextualize these geospatial assets to compose a visual prosopography of those surfaces."

        "abstract": "Aural transposition sits at a crossroads between being a tool for practice and creating work, and being a tool that illuminates aspects of another entity. In day-to-day music practice, transposition can be an age-old tool for learning material, or a multi-layered exploration of an object or place. Transposition can also be a means of recreating places, real or imagined, through the transposition of ghost traces back into sound. And the transposition of spaces onto other spaces is possible through multichannel sound arrays. The territory for re-imagining both sound and place lies in the impossible space between the sounding entity at hand and the instrument that transposes it. Just as in the d\u00e9rive of psychogeography, the spaces between well-trod paths leads to a world beyond the banal. This exposition first situates these practices in psychogeography, and amongst other artists whose work utilizes various transposition, soundwalking or psychogeographical practices. It then discusses those aspects of my own artistic practice and work\u2014across a spectrum of electroacoustic music, improvised violin work and collaborative composition for an ensemble of mechanical string instruments\u2014 that are centered around aural transposition as an act of psychogeography."

The work explores specific systems and pushes the limits of their intended use.\r\n\r\nIn the process, I also hope to reveal the relationship between digital systems and transformative subjects. The work Radical Inside explores 3D models from the largest sharing platform for 3D content. A multiplicity of possibilities opens up as a shift in camera perspective reveals the internal structure of the 3D models. The reorientation points to criticism of how society is structured and imagined by the heteronormative gaze. The unusual angle displaces the normative placement of the model within a reduced and rigid system - the taxonomy and categorization of the platform. From within, I can highlight and explore technology as a fundamentally surreal and queer possibility."

        "abstract": "In this exposition I wish to point to a type of artistic research evolving around development of technology as artistic material, as an extension to the condition of possibility for an artistic expression. The well known distinction between research *for* and research *in* the arts, in my opinion becomes blurred in these type of works. Those tools developed to facilitate the artistic exploration constitute the base material for the artist, and the development of these tools are an intrinsic part of the artistic process. The examples are shown as recorded sound and video, and the technological material is thus still hidden from the reader. They can not see the material itself, just the traces it leaves. I would argue that the artistic process here starts with the investigation of potential, guiding the development of tools, and the tools will have certain affordances correlating with some aspects of the original artistic spark (desire). The artistic process of exploring said affordances will also in many cases lead to unexpected outcomes, in the interaction between human and machine, artist and tool"

        "abstract": "In this essay I describe two projects within the field of visual art. Both works are examples of how the workflow techniques of digital photography can be modified in order to produce artworks that take on a distinct physicality and objecthood, and, as such, may form a spatial and/or haptic relation with the viewer. I discuss how such an approach relates to the ability of photography to point beyond the physical situation of viewing due to the particular virtuality of the photograph. By relating my work to the ideas of Vil\u00e9m Flusser and Roland Barthes, recent theory on photography and photographic indexicality, as well as contemporary artistic work, I speculate here on how my own work illuminates perceptions of the photograph and understandings of the role of photography in today\u2019s media culture and economy."

        "abstract": "Stacey Sacks is a PhD candidate in Performing Arts at Stockholm\u2019s University of the Arts. Her Doctoral Project *This Untethered Buffoon or the Trickster in Everything* takes form as a suite of hyper-disciplinary experiments with mask, clown, stop-motion animation, film, photography, sculpture, text, drawing and performance.\r\n\r\nDrawing on Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak\u2019s concept of \u2018critical intimacy\u2019 the performance-essay 'luxurious migrant' reflects on whiteness and privilege and the performance of it. As an intra-cultural, auto-ethnographic excavation it attempts and possibly fails to critically engage with notions of access, authority and power from within the cultural canon. As such it is a creative experimentation with theory and performance, an exploration of the improvisatory impulse and what it means to be \u2018on\u2019 the moment.\r\n\r\nSince clown naturally contains transgressive elements, the project explores how the genre can be used in a neo-colonial context to subvert or interrupt the dominant discourse, whether satire and parody function as activism and if it is in fact possible to push back white supremacy through critical engagement and play, starting with a robust self-critique."

The interventions proposed by Melliferopolis create shared spaces of encounters for Bees and Humans. The choice to work with these insects in an urban and participatory setting creates situations that are surprising, unpredictable or challenge concepts of \"safety\". The exposition aims to develop an understanding for risks that arise when collaborating with non human animals, explores reactions to situations that are not entirely controllable and elaborates on notions of safety, hazard and unpredictability within practice based artistic research. As the territory to investigate these questions we look at interventions, performances and installations produced in public spaces in the city of Helsinki in the framework of Melliferopolis since 2012."

        "abstract": "Between 1956 and 1968, the photographer Gholamreza Amirbegi captured a wealth of images from around his neighborhood in southwestern Tehran. At the time the city had just seen a major influx of working-class immigrants from the country\u2019s smaller municipalities. By re-narrating these materials, which evoke not only particular, local memories, but also distinct subaltern histories, this overlooked archive tells stories of social change from below in Iran, as seen in Gholamreza\u2019s subjects: global cinematic images, and unconscious colonial memory. By applying a comparative historical-material analysis, Khosravi Noori\u2019s aim here is to develop a practice based, multi-sited archaeology of contemporary history. This approach begins with an excavation of the historical materials themselves, in order to both discover lost identities in these images, and to displace them from sedimented historical positions. In doing this, he asks the question: What happens to the past from the vantage point of the future?"

The project is a response to the romanticised and idealised image of the folkhem which, in the current political climate, is mainly propagated by the far right with the populist and racist Swedish Democrats (SD) at the forefront. Using the artists own \u201cfolkhem-marinated\u201d body as a point of departure, the exposition sketches the nodes from which the folkhem unfolded and how that created the preconditions for certain people to feel at home while others were excluded. In mapping the \u201cfolkhem nodes\u201d photographic documentation, notes of childhood memories and a conversation with the father is used. The project investigates how the folkhem ideology was implemented through a linguistic as well as a spatial and material aesthetics. The textual memories are contextualized through a system of footnotes, that in the exposition are shown in pop-up windows and act as a commenting and associative parallel text to the memory narratives."

New approaches to interactions between performers and composers. The research project took place at the University of Bergen, Faculty of Art, Music and Design, Grieg Academy \u2013 Department of Music, from 2015 to 2018 under the auspices of the Norwegian Artistic Research Programme. The project led to three concerts and a sound installation. This exposition presents documentation of the results and gives an account of the research materials, tools and work methods, as well as discussing ethical and aesthetical dimensions of the working processes and the results."

With the essay film Days In Between Marianna Christofides and her collaborator Bernd Br\u00e4unlich recursively visited the Balkans between 2011 and 2015, at first seeking out littoral borders where the course of the boundary remains indefinite. Rivers as invisible yet politically instrumental borders was one of the initial narrative strands. Having lost the first few years worth of audiovisual material, the data on the hard drive being unretrievable, they decided to return, only to find that the places no longer existed in the same way. Both topography and social fabric in ceaseless flux. Their approach extended accordingly, now focusing on loss, omissions, obfuscation and disappearance. The appropriation of nature\u2019s workings in political discourse came to the fore. As did the filmmaker\u2019s inhibiting yet empowering fringe location. Through a reflective lens of doubt agency was re-calibrated. The project grew wider in a recurring attempt at approaching, and began to expand, up until the present and in multiple iterations. Within this non-finite process the constant failure, and the beginning anew, became integral parts of the narrative."

One of the groups are men that during the 1970s and \u201880s chose to perform non-combatant service and now reflect on the choices they made as 18-year olds. The other group consists of young people of today trying to answer several questions regarding the right to take another person's life. The exposition is part of the artistic research project Refuse to Kill \u2013 stories of the conscientious objectors. Our methodology involves a montage of a large number of voices collectively collected through statistical surveys, open-call procedure via advertising in newspapers and the internet, interviews and searches in archives."

        "abstract": "In contemporary music, the ethos of experimentation and newness is constantly confronted with a strong historical presence. The historical residue in the apparatus of production and dissemination can be found in the instrumentation, institutions and formats of performance. Certain periods in time, like that of post-war modernism tried to eviscerate that residue, other periods have seen a keen interest in evoking history, for a variety of reasons. Eivind Buene\u2019s ongoing project Schubert Lounge probes notions of historicity in an explicit way, taking songs of Franz Schubert as a starting point for the investigation. The work challenges the idea of authenticity in musical performance through applying methodologies from one layer in time to materials from a different historical moment. In the project he tries to create a multi-layered experience through a process of \u2018telescopic listening\u2019, as different modes of interpretation and creation is brought into conflict in a staged work for singers, ensemble and turntable with recorded sound."

Lineage strings together these seemingly separate ways of gaining knowledge: official archives and private stories, his archive of somatic approaches and attempts to research land somatically \u2013 to think about what it was like to live in a body in rural Norway 100 years ago and ask how this affects how we are living in our bodies now. This exposition reflects a project that includes a video installation, a studio practice, and a performance which uses his archive of videos, stories, and movement. Here he shares thoughts about how we care for and engage in our personal histories and\r\nhow this engagement changes how we are living in our bodies now.\r\n\r\nIn this exposition you will see or hear the following people, listed in their order of appearance: Otto Ramstad, Lisa Nelson, Maura Gahan, Margit Galanter, Kristin Van Loon, Steve Paxton, Emmett Ramstad, Hans Steinar Gjerdet, Carle Lange, Olive Bieringa, Uma Rabbit Bieringa Ramstad, Andrea Parkins."

During a two-week workshop the choir and Mareike Dobewall explored how to vocalise other stories, of the inhabitants of Demmin and the two decaying buildings known collectively as Haus Demmin (the ruins of an 11th century fortress and a former mansion). In a sonic dialogue between ageing voices and decaying architecture a vocal performance in the open air was created. Stories, history and fairy tales took new shape through vocal music, and un-listened sound was given presence. The site-determined performance allowed for the memory and the imagination of the visitors and the participants to rise up and become a part of a holistic experience."

        "abstract": "This exposition responds to the current flux of migration and the resulting condition of estrangement. The projects \u2013 an augmented book project and a corresponding media artwork \u2013 respond to mass migration, hyper-mobility, placeless-ness and nomadism, which are blurring the boundaries between the local and the global, the corporeal and the digital, the private and the public. Through an exploration of the poetic and critical capacities embedded in everyday listening the two projects attempt to shed light on the aesthetics of addressing the notion of exile, alienation and estrangement. The exposition let the viewer/reader engage with the artistic matter; namely, the field recordings and on-site writings - artistic acts of poetic contemplation grounded in a personal experience of the urban alienation, with the aim of movement towards self-understanding and emancipation."

        "abstract": "The life studio is an eccentric place and this exposition is populated by eccentric characters. The drawings and photographs contained in this research have all been created by studio puppets. Each puppet's awkward methods of working \u2014 stabbing, pulling, twisting a clutching hand \u2014 magnify the work\u2019s unorthodox strategy. Puppets will illuminate the idiosyncrasies, malfunctions and estrangements typically surfeited in the life studio\u2019s private sphere. This research responds to the work of E.T.A. Hoffmann (\u2018Spin, puppet, spin\u2019) and George M\u00e9li\u00e8s; puppet/art hybrid exhibitions; the Puppet Master horror franchise;  and the lay figure of Gustave Courbet. Puppets are not alien in the life studio. Although they were typically concealed in the artist's process and hidden from public view, they were common fixtures until the 20th century. This exposition estranges artists and models from the life drawing apparatus and invites puppets to make pictures."

I do not consider adoption a \u2018win-win situation\u2019, and I encourage people to think critically about the practice as well as the glorification of it. The colorblindness with which I was encountered as a PoC growing up with white parents was an existential complication for me. I was plagued by feelings I could not understand at the time and grew isolated. I want to visually express the feeling of being estranged and alienated from one\u2019s own body and the fear of drowning in one\u2019s own skin. I have often felt compelled to unzip my skin suit and leave it next to my trousers in a heap on the floor. In this project, I grow my own skin in a vat \u2013 or more specifically, I grow a kombucha culture in tea and sugar. During the fermentation process, the kombucha culture creates a cellulose material that resembles human flesh. The process is a slow one, and developing the material demands a great deal of love and nutrition. In return, I get a self-produced material that enables me to work independently."

        "abstract": "This exposition is a semi-dialogical inquiry into the potential of the methods and poetics of estrangement in documentary and political cinema, where we focus on the representation of the \u201cneoliberal condition\u201d in present-day society. We reflect on and rethink ideas that stem from various theories and strategies of emancipatory practices in cinema and literature. Here we acknowledge the tensions between conventions in for example social documentary, political cinema, and different conceptions of realism versus the idea of estrangement as an artistic strategy. The struggle to emancipate spectatorship\u00a0and readership\u00a0from the passivity and uncritical temptations promoted by the spectacles of the hegemonic culture industries has been a central concern in theoretical debates and artistic praxis that involves estrangement as a technique. How do Jacques Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s notions on emancipation and radical equality challenge Brechtian ideas and methods of estrangement? How could the lineages of Third Cinema and testimonial literature help to rethink these matters today?\u00a0What are actually the relevant means of estrangement in contemporary documentary art\u00a0and literature?"

        "abstract": "Animalium is a continuation of the artistic research project Neither Fish nor Fowl which investigates the significance of affect in performing arts for kindergarten kids and consists of theatre-making, film making and writing. Affect has been philosophical, emotional, and material inspiration in the creative process, and in relation to the young children audience. The theatre project developed by Teater Fot is Inspired by posthumanist philosophies, and the project investigates human as animal in musical and sympoietic interplay with young children. We investigate the strange and weird in-between, in transition, in the undefinable; neither fish nor fowl, but perhaps chickenlion, orangerobot, dragonurchin or birdfish? The exposition is a translation from theatre to text, pictures, sound and video, and explores how the translation twists, twirks and turns the theatre into virtuality. By this translation details come close-up and new shapes and colours emerge \u2013 the body and space of theatre are transformed and translated into the strange materiality of the screen, and the work will expand in time."

        "abstract": "The ultimate act of taking risk in life lays in the proximity to death. When a risk being taken is prone to fail, failure can potentially become the failure to live. These risky moments involve decisions, dreams, imaginings that motivate one to take action. The motivation is strong enough to push one to a fragile border between death and life.\r\nIn this exposition, I situate the discussion of risk in coal mines, investigating the work of coal miners as a craft through which they develop subversive modes of labour. The story in this exposition starts millions of years ago and gives a fictional geological history of Earth, where the formation of coal plays an important role in the planet\u2019s evolution; coal becomes the political summary of Earth, where various moments of risk lead us down into a coal mine. Through a vertical structure poised on the edge of death and life, and by means of writing and drawing, risk is experimented with using concepts such as imprecision, the materiality of darkness, and the fragility of working with such materiality."

        "abstract": "There is a fundamental enthusiasm and curiosity that drives our attitude towards experimentation. Free basic research is the fundament for all new apprehensions. Each production leads us into new landscapes. Experimentation is artistic immersion.The concept of risk and possible failure is a natural part of this experimentation.Without taking risk, art would remain stagnant, and the creative spirit would be wasted on our own fears.\r\nIn this exposition we will elucidate some of the many fields of interest and tools for expression we have worked with during the development of our latest production \u2013 HANNAH \u2013 which premiered September 2017 at Henie Onstad Art Center in Oslo in connection with the Ultima Festival. In HANNAH Verdensteatret works with elaborate spatial compositions that provokes a state of absorption in an immersive audio-visual space. These compositions consists of material generated in an electronic feedback system. This material forms a sedimentation process that unfolds as a fixed attention towards exhaustion and the act of observing slow changes. Like a physical object slowly affect its surroundings. A production from Verdensteatret is a glimpse of a present, a state of transitions and passages through phenomenons. The present is a memory in motion. At the same time, there has never been so much past as right now."

        "abstract": "This essay is about risk in artistic research. It is about obstacles and turning points; a shift away from the familiar and move towards an unfamiliar terrain. It begins on a boat, heading to the North of Norway, in the darkness. December 2012 is when I turn away from a media art practice and move towards a more socially-engaged, activist way of working. I depart from Bergen; eventually arriving in Madrid, in the middle of an eviction crisis. Along the journey, I will invite various people to think with me, which takes the work in unplanned and unintended directions. I understand risk in the sense of \u2018staying with the trouble\u2019 (Haraway) until it becomes quite clear what is at stake. It is the risk we will take in finding meaning, by trying to locate the means to exist in and act on the present."

        "abstract": "This exposition considers how investigative poetic practices could broaden notions of \u2018forensis\u2019 in terms of contemporary art. By developing my concept of \u2018poetic forensics\u2019 with attunement as a method that is \u201cpalpable and sensory, yet imaginary and uncontained\u201d (Stewart 2011) it admits the nonhuman\u2014trees, rocks, streams, animals\u2014suggesting new relations beyond the human as possible witnesses (Williams 2018). This presents an invitation to think differently about articulations of public truth. The question \u2018Who else is witness?' emerges while exploring material intrinsically elusive to testimony on what and who has been disappeared by oppressive geopolitics. Human-rights issues are implicit given the project\u2019s focus on historical erasure and state violence at \u201cthe threshold of detectability\u201d (Weizman 2017). It also attends to my family\u2019s experiences as we faced the \u201cpolitical disappearance\u201d of my father Iv\u00e1n Daza, in 1960s Cold War-era Venezuela. The project grapples with validity through methods and lively approaches that decolonize both knowledge (Tuhiwai Smith 1999) and nature (Demos 2016) presenting posthuman challenges to a privileged human onto-epistemological position (Viveiros de Castro 2015)."

        "abstract": "This exposition discusses risks that emerge from the artistic researcher\u2019s fluid position within artistic research. The research entails the artistic researcher interviewing vaccine-critical parents and a vaccine scientist about their opposing standpoints toward immunization and vaccination, while remaining ambivalent and sympathetic toward both views. The exposition uses concepts such as positionality, insider-outsider, and sameness to unpack the various risks arising from the stimulation and staging of conflicting voices about vaccines. These risks include upset participants due to unmet expectations raised partially by the artistic researcher\u2019s understanding attitude, and the pervasiveness of the \u201cvoice\u201d of the documentary film being created throughout the artist-researcher\u2019s interactions with the participants."

And, right in the midst of it; the encounter of \u201czen\u201d in chaos. When I, by chance, came across an article on danger music it became clear that danger in music already was conceptualized. What sort of experiences do we share? What accesses to understand the phenomena danger music is there? What place can these seldom and special experiences of mine of quiet, calm and clearness have in danger music?"

When I returned to making sculpture I found I could only relate to previous artwork by breaking it. I explore how and why my aesthetic preferences changed after experiencing injury, in particular the new element of risk. I reflect on contrasting experiences of mountain biking and being injured, the tension between the support and restriction of being in plaster and my alienation to my broken arm. Through this I question what motivates people to take risks, how our judgement of risk can change in different circumstances, and if the motivation for men and women taking risks is different. I reflect on the risk to the artwork and to the viewer and different forms of risk in artwork. Finally I recount how this informs the making of 'risk' 2011 and 'Celebration' 2015."

Do they have their own aesthetics, their own processes and patterns of movement, their own environmental structures and psychology \u2013 and do they share some of these characteristics? The texts and pictures in this exposition, four essays all together, deal with the potential of mountain climbing and painting to map out space, quietude, euphoria, fear, skill, autonomy, instrumentality and movement in an expanded field."

When we eradicate a place in the exterior world, we lose a major pathway into our own history.\u201d Lena Lindgren, Morgenbladet, 2. November 2012\r\n\r\nThe project is based on a real place, a house in Oslo. I am interested in how our memory connects with places and houses, in expanding our understanding of what a house and a place are, seen from the perspective of our own cultural background, time and history \u2013 and in the perceptions and experiences that are associated with it. In the significance of how the rooms are organised in relation to each other and what happens if the room is freed from the context in which it stands. It is rare to experience an isolated room that doesn\u2019t relate to anything else, torn from its place, time and spatial context. The neutral room simply doesn\u2019t exist. A key aspect of architecture is the experience of going from one room to another. The way the rooms are organised in relation to each other affects the sense of what it is like to be in the house. From the starting point that architecture begins with a single room, I have explored what criteria a space has to fulfil to be called a room and how big it has to be. Everyone relates to rooms \u2013 whether it is a private room like a bedroom, kitchen, dining room, or a public space such as a caf\u00e9, library or railway station. The work comprises six physical installations, plus the book and archive \u201c33 fortellinger\u201d (33 stories)."

        "abstract": "The language of art is often poetic and abstract. \r\nReduced and lawless in terms of grammar. I experience the poetic and abstract language as closer to the experienced world than the more concrete and descriptive language that is the norm in the majority of formulations in society. In my artistic practice at the moment, I work with color, movement and time. In the video medium. To say that art is a language is also an assertion, or a worn metaphor. We have no written language rules we agree upon in the arts, no defined alphabet. And maybe that's exactly what the making of art is? Creating form, while challenging form? Being the practitioner, and in that sense defining, in a landscape of concrete and abstract, in definite and indefinite and fluid and solid.\r\nTo create while shaping the form of it, is something else than performing within a given formation.\r\nThis contribution to a digital catalogue for artistic research are selections of my work, and thoughts, related to it translated into pieces of texts.\r\nSome pieces of text along with some video pieces as well as a print from a video, a so-called 'still'. They are selected to function in different constellations, and for several reasons. A collage as a method and a way to relate to my own work, and with the selection, emphasizes the content of the texts. I apply my own thesis discussed in the text upon my contribution 'here' *. My contribution appears in Vis \u2013 Nordic Journal for Artistic Research. The digital is representation. It is not. It is equally important to me that this contributed in form acknowledges that making a presence in an internet-based database is not without hyperlinks. It appears because the other is.\r\n* Where is 'here', what is 'here'?\r\n(Video and video with sound.) \r\n\r\nThe visual material in this exposition is from the videos 'La ditt liv vitne'(2017), 'Essay on Colour'(2017) and Perceptual Cycle (2016).

        "abstract": "The performer\u2019s perspective and the impact of collaboration on the performer\u2019s artistic practice is often overlooked in frameworks designed to analyze collaboration in contemporary music. The conception of what a performer is \u2018for\u2019 in the development of a new musical piece is, at least in part,  what constitutes a performer\u2019s artistic practice, whether that is the performer as an interpreter and executor of scores, as an adviser to the composer, and/or as a co-creating deviser. The interpreter-adviser-deviser model is conceived as a framework for considering the ways composer-performer collaborations can influence and contribute to the construction of a performer\u2019s artistic practice and subjectivity. Collaboration is not only a method of creating new works, it's also a method for creating artistic practices. Drawing on examples of devised practices as exhibited in Jennifer Torrence\u2019s artistic research, practices which are communicated through reflections, dialogues, images, and videos, the article ultimately argues that it is the performer as deviser that offers the most radical rethinking of the purpose, role, and potential of the performer in contemporary music collaboration."

        "abstract": "Free improvised music allows me as a musician to be able to change direction at any time. Free improvised  music is the only form of music where I can completely change my way of  playing  depending on the character  of  the room or the space. The room becomes a co-player that I can either go along with or resist. In my project I investigate different ways to explore and clarify  how changes of direction in free improvisation can be performed and how the spatial conditions and other conditions affect the way the music is played. The form of improvised music I am examining is extremely dialogue-oriented, where action and reaction within the dialogue in the room play a vital role in the process. What I would like to try out and demonstrate is how a sonic language entirely based on the participants\u2019  sensitivity can  be  moulded, i.e.  a  language  that  is altogether based on the listening and playing of a person in a particular space. The sounding image process that becomes a link to the narrative text. Through the use of sound, text and image, and all their mixed forms, and drawing from my experiences  as a musician and composer, I hope it will be possible for  you to follow this twisty way toward something."
