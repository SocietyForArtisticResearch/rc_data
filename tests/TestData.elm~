The bibliographic part of the research has relied heavily on articles and reviews published in the field of experimental psychology (for more information on this go to the chapter on Current state of knowledge), but also on different publications related to the notion of ritual (see\\u00a0Aldridge, 2007; Brumberg-Kraus, 2020; Sennett, 2013), and a number of cookbooks and books about food (see Evans et al., 2017; McFadden, 2017; Pollan, 2011; Redzepi & Zilber, 2018; Robertson, 2013a, 2013b; Shih et al., 2020; Shockey & Shockey, 2019; Slater, 2009, amongst others). \\nThere has also been an important experimental component to this research, as I designed two performances that were presented in a sort of laboratory setting, and one public performance, all of which contributed to the contents of this research in an essential way. This contribution was partly through the analysis of the process of designing the experimental performances themselves, including the composition and performance of the music and the creation of the recipes for and cooking of the food, and partly through the collection of (qualitative) feedback from the audience who attended these performances. My own work and my experience of it both during and after its creation have therefore been considered as two of the main subjects of this study.\\n\\nDesigning the experiments\\nOne of the challenges in designing the experiments for this research, which would at the same time function as prototypes for real-life performances, was to find a format for them that would balance an element of familiarity with the novelty of the experience. Novelty and familiarity need to be balanced in order to achieve an adequate arousal level in the guest, since too much familiarity would result in a lack of stimuli and an apathetic level of engagement with the performance, while a completely novel experience would result in a hyper-aroused state that would virtually eliminate the ability of the guest to engage with their environment (Aldridge, 2007, pp. 5-6). As Michael Bom Fr\\u00f8st states in relation to the novelty vs. familiarity of food, what is interesting is that \\u201cexperienced novelty and familiarity are not necessarily inversely correlated; rather, they can be completely uncorrelated - a food can be experienced by the eater as both highly familiar and highly novel. A food that strikes a sound chord of recognition, yet still gives the eater the excitement of trying something new, is a sure success\\u201d (2017, p. 46). This was what I tried to achieve during the experiments, an experience that would be perceived by the guests as very familiar and highly novel at the same time.\\u00a0\\nWhen exploring examples of food and music pairings that had been done in the recent past, I discovered that most of them relied on the music not being performed live, and basically had the form of a restaurant dinner in which every guest either had a small speaker in front of them, or was listening to the music through a set of headphones (this fits very well into the definition of 'sonic seasoning', a term further explained in the chapter Current state of knowledge). This, which according to Ben Gouge, the creator of the so-called 'food opera', is essential \\u201cin order not to impinge on the dining experience\\u201d (Houge, 2012),\\u00a0went directly against my desire of creating a live performance experience in which food and music would be paired. I therefore decided that the element of familiarity would not be that of a restaurant dinner, but that the basic format for the experiments would be that of a concert, in which the audience would be facing the musicians, and not each other around a dinner table. Each guest would be handed a plate containing several dishes at the beginning of the performance, they would hold the plate in their hands while sitting and listening, and they would eat the different dishes when indicated to do so.\\nAfter each of the two experiments, the participants were asked to fill out a feedback form. Once everyone had finished, there was a discussion in which the participants shared their impressions of the experiment and asked questions. Lastly, I shared some insighs into how the experiment had been designed and the underlying philosophy of the research.\\u00a0\\nThose who participated in the experiments will be referred to indistinctly as either 'participants', 'audience', 'guests', or simply 'attendants'. The word 'diners' has been purposefully avoided due to the basic concert-like format of the experiments.\\nAfter carrying out the two experiments, I had the opportunity of trying out all the conclusions I had come to in a public performance, which will from now on be referred to by its name,\\u00a0Four Bites of Autumn. The conditions of each of the two experiments and Four Bites of Autumn are described below.\\n\\nThe completed audience feedback forms can be found in Appendix 3.\\nExperiment 1For the first experiment, I decided that all the music would be composed by myself, and that I would also take charge of designing and cooking the food. The experiment was carried out on the 2nd of April 2022 at 16:00, in Studio 4 at the Royal Conservatoire The Hague. There were 19 participants who gave their informed consent prior to taking part in the experiment. The performers were Julia Hern\\u00e1ndez S\\u00e1nchez on the baroque violin and myself on the traverso. The participants were seated in two concentric semicircles around the performers. The main focus point in the design of the pairing between the food and the music were crossmodal correspondences between basic taste and different musical parameters (for more information on this, go to the section\\u00a0Mediating elements. Crossmodal correspondences).\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1956315",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 2500px; width: 1010px; height: 286px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 3; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "2500px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "286px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nExperiment 2\\nAgain, all the music and food were conceived by myself.

The food of the experiment was meant to portray the period of the year known as the \\u2018hungry gap\\u2019, that is, the time when the last winter vegetables have been consumed, and the spring vegetables are not yet ready to be harvested (The Community Farm, 2021). At this time of year, traditionally, only a few ingredients would have been at hand: a few overwintered roots left in the soil, and some dried grains, seeds, and legumes.\\u00a0With such a limited choice of ingredients at hand, I pursued the idea of trying to transform them in as many ways as I could think of. Here are some examples of the treatment I gave to each ingredient while designing the experiment (not everything made it to the final dishes, of course):\\n\\nLinseeds: sprouted, toasted, or mixed into sweet and savoury doughs and batters.\\nParsnips: baked into chips, steamed and pur\\u00e9ed, cooked and fermented with a sourdough starter, raw and fermented in a salt brine, or used as a starch in an amazake preparation.\\nSpelt and barley:\\n\\n- As flour: in breads and cakes, or fermented with a sourdough starter.\\n- As whole or pearled berries: fermented into koji (then fried, or used in a miso or amazake preparation), sprouted, or toasted and boiled.\\n- As porridge flakes: cooked into porridge, fermented with a sourdough starter.\\n\\nKapucijners: as a hummus, as the main ingredient of a miso, or sprouted.\\n\\nAs can be seen above, different fermentation techniques were used to approach the ingredients, as I consider these some of the best ways to complexify and coax out new flavours of the same ingredient.\\u00a0I set myself the challenge of including all five basic ingredients in the three dishes, which were meant to nevertheless have a very contrasting flavour.The three dishes that were finally served were:\\n\\nParsnip pur\\u00e9e with kapucijner miso, served on a piece of spelt and barley porridge sourdough bread and garnished with toasted linseeds.\\nKapucijner and wild garlic hummus, served on a piece of Danish-style sourdough bread with spelt, toasted barley berries, and linseeds, and garnished with a parsnip chip.\\u00a0\\nParsnip spelt cake with kapucijner miso and linseeds.\\n\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1956056",                "style": "left: 168px; top: 3906px; width: 1010px; height: 915px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 6; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "168px",                    "3906px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "915px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nExperiment 2\\nBecause of the results of Experiment 1 (which are discussed in the section Mediating elements. Crossmodal correspondences), I decided that my focus point for Experiment 2 would be texture, both culinary and musical. To have several contrasting textures was therefore one of the starting points during the creation of the recipes for its different dishes. \\nThe beginning of autumn symbolising plenty for me, I decided that I wanted to include an element made with a fresh vegetable, one made with grains and seeds, and one made with mushrooms. \\nI knew that I wanted something crispy, and since the parsnip chip had proved one of the most popular elements of the first experiment, I decided to again make a root vegetable chip, this time with beetroot, however, which I judged to represent the season better. \\nMy starting point to determine which types of textures I would use for this experiment was mostly conditioned by the musical material (more on this in the section Mediating elements. Semantic matching). I knew that I wanted something light and airy, something crispy, and something coarse and flaky.\\nAfter reading some of the work of Ferran Adri\\u00e0 (2004), who has been a great pioneer in finding and exploring different culinary textures, I decided that a culinary foam or \\u2018espuma\\u2019 would be the best to conform to the adjectives \\u2018light\\u2019 and \\u2018airy\\u2019. I decided to make a wild mushroom foam, since August and September are generally the best months for mushroom foraging in the Netherlands. After a long period of trial and error, however, I was not able to make the kind of foam I was hoping for with agar, which seemed the best vegan alternative to gelatine. I decided to give the audience of the experiment the option to choose between the mushroom foam, which I ended up making with gelatine, and a vegan mushroom pat\\u00ea, which could fulfil a similar role in the experiment (albeit with a different texture). Only one of the participants chose this vegan alternative, so the results of the experiment were not substantially influenced. \\nLastly, I wanted to have an element in the dish that would feature grains and seeds in some form. As I was thinking about texture, I had the idea of making a paratha, a type of Indian flatbread bread made with \\u2018atta\\u2019, a very finely ground wholegrain wheat flour, usually layered with ghee or another type of fat, which makes the bread very flaky. I substituted the wheat with a more local grain, spelt, and chose for cold-pressed sunflower seed oil for the fat, the taste of sunflower seeds being a symbol of late summer in my imagination.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1956092",                "style": "left: 168px; top: 5176px; width: 1010px; height: 485px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 6; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "168px",                    "5176px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "485px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nFour Bites of AutumnI will elaborate less on the food that was served during the public performance Four Bites of Autumn than on that of the experiments, because the recipes were created and cooked by the staff of Bij de Roos, the caf\\u00e9 in Delft where the performance took place.

Our choices in what, when, where, and how we eat have a weight that goes beyond the mere act of nourishing ourselves. I was very conscious of this when I set out to research the topic of pairing food and music\\u2013\\u00a0very conscious of the fact that there would be no \\u2018innocent\\u2019 choices in the food that I would serve my audience during the research experiments. Before I started creating the different dishes and composing the music, I would have to ask myself and respond to the following questions:\\n\\nWhat sort of food would be eaten during the experiments? I decided to use ingredients that had undergone as little processing as possible, that were produced as close to where I was as I could manage, that were fresh and in season, and that were exclusively plant-based. Each of the experiments would also feature at least one locally foraged ingredient, the ultimate expression of seasonality, in my view. The food would take the shape of one- or two- bite dishes, similar to the tapas I had grown up eating and loving in Salamanca, my home city in Spain.\\nWhen would the experiments take place? Since I had decided to perform two research experiments and I had a bit less than one year to carry them out, I decided to space them about half a year apart. One took place on the 2nd of April 2022, the other one on the 24th of September 2022. I decided for these two moments because they coincided approximately with two changes of season: from winter to spring, and from summer to autumn, respectively.\\u00a0\\nWhere would the experiments take place? For logistic reasons, I chose to carry out the experiments in one of the studios at Amare, the location of the Royal Conservatoire The Hague. These studios are mostly used for musical performances and, as I wanted the format of the experiments to resemble the experience of a concert rather than that of a restaurant dinner, this seemed appropriate.\\nHow would this food be eaten during the experiments? I wanted to imbue the eating during the performances with the quality of ritual, and wanted the act of eating to carry a dramatic expression that would invite to a more mindful eating experience (more information on this can be found in the section Mediating elements. Ritual).\\n\\nSince I have never worked in the food industry, but am merely a home cook, I decided to acquaint myself with the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles in order to ensure the safety of the food I would be preparing for the experiments. HACCP is defined as \\u201ca system which provides the framework for monitoring the total food system, from harvesting to consumption, to reduce the risk of foodborne illness\\u201d (University of Rhode Island, 2023).\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nWhy seasonal food?Around six years ago I started taking the seasons into account when cooking. It was first through the books of Nigel Slater\\u00a0and later through the philosophy of the Danish restaurant noma and that of its head chef Ren\\u00e9 Redzepi\\u00a0that I fell in love with the idea of telling a story about the time and place one found oneself in through the food that one ate and served to others. Discovering all the beautiful root vegetables that I could easily find in the Netherlands and that I had never encountered in Spain (such as Jerusalem artichokes, salsifies, parsnips, swede, yellow beetroot, black radish, and all kinds of turnips) made me feel connected to this new country I was living in, in a way that I had not been able to experience before. I also began to learn more about the edible potential of the nature that surrounded me, and foraging plants and mushrooms helped me to relate to my environment even more and feel at home in a place that was starting to feel less and less foreign.Intentionally sourcing my ingredients from local producers helped me connect to people I would have otherwise never met, it enriched my social circle, and ultimately also contributed to my feeling of belonging in and to this place.Binding myself to the rhythms of the seasons changed my relationship to and perception of time. The arrival of spring, with its longer and more frequently sunny days, suddenly also meant the promise of asparagus, sweet peas, and broad beans, and the relief of the brassicas and root vegetables I had been feeding on for months. It also meant that I could watch the shoots of wild garlic and common hogweed grow until they reached the right size to harvest them\\u2013 that I could watch them flower, go to seed, and then die away until the following year. By the beginning of autumn, after having had my share of courgettes, aubergines, tomatoes, and bell peppers, I would be longing for exactly those cabbages and roots I had been so tired of only a few months before.Lastly, limiting myself to using ingredients that were in season made me a much better and versatile cook. As is discussed in the section Mediating elements during the creative process, constraint spurs creativity. I could no longer rely on my one or two go-to recipes for each vegetable that I would cyclically return to, because I would have eaten the same every couple of days. Instead, I learned to find variety in the few ingredients that were available to me at any given time by exploring different preparations and manners of processing them.My wish to combine food and music in live performances was to a great extent sparked by the desire to share this experience of connection and belonging, of expectant yearning and creative joy, with others. I tried to incorporate the ideas of locality and seasonality as much as possible in the form of the research, and decided to design it in such a way that it would orbit around the axis created by two experiments, separated from each other in time by half a year, each showcasing some seasonal and local ingredients.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1956122",                "style": "left: 183px; top: 5956px; width: 295px; height: 114px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "183px",                    "5956px"                ],                "size": [                    "295px",                    "114px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nPumpkin and carrot soup with pumpkin sourdough bread served during Four Bites of Autumn\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1956036",                "style": "left: 308px; top: 2451px; width: 355px; height: 115px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "308px",                    "2451px"                ],                "size": [                    "355px",                    "115px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nAn abundance of wild garlic (Allium ursinum), a wild ingredient featured in Experiment 1\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1955986",                "style": "left: 308px; top: 3806px; width: 345px; height: 65px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "308px",                    "3806px"                ],                "size": [                    "345px",                    "65px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nThe three dishes served during Experiment 1\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1956088",                "style": "left: 323px; top: 5091px; width: 320px; height: 95px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "323px",                    "5091px"                ],                "size": [                    "320px",                    "95px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nThe three textural elements served during Experiment 2 (non-vegan version)\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1956126",                "style": "left: 578px; top: 6001px; width: 220px; height: 119px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "578px",                    "6001px"                ],                "size": [                    "220px",                    "119px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nRye bread with apple syrup served during Four Bites of Autumn\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1955987",                "style": "left: 703px; top: 3806px; width: 355px; height: 110px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 5; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "703px",                    "3806px"                ],                "size": [                    "355px",                    "110px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nLinseeds, barley berries, pearled spelt berries, and a parsnip.

As will be seen, some of these mediating elements may also be of help when seeking ways to connect performers and audience, or to integrate the performance space into the meaning of the performance itself. They might therefore not only be of use to someone designing a food and music pairing, but to anyone who wishes to establish a coherent and synergistic relationship between the different components of any performance.\\u00a0\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1965249",                "style": "padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "0px",                    "0px"                ],                "size": [                    "330.664px",                    "110px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nReturn to homepage\\n\\n"            }        ],        "1755607": [            {                "id": "tool-1965463",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 25px; width: 345px; height: 125px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 6; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "25px"                ],                "size": [                    "345px",                    "125px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\n\\n\\nAppendix 1.

The reason for this was that I wanted to have as complete a control as possible over the different components that were going to be part of these performances, which was also the reason why I decided to perform in the experiments myself. In addition to this, I wanted to experience how the creation 'from scratch' of each of these components would influence my creative process when working on the other ones (more on this can be read in the section\\u00a0Mediating elements during the creative process). Once I decided that I would compose the music, the first question I had to address was what instrumentation I would use for the experiments. I had already decided that I would be performing myself, and chose to write the music for traverso instead of modern flute or 8-keyed Classical flute because I had wanted to explore the timbral possibilities of this instrument in a new music context for a while. I also felt attracted by the intimacy that the sound of the traverso would necessarily impart to the experiments, given its limited dynamic range, and was interested in how this intimacy might be reflected in the food that I would be serving. Apart from the traverso, I decided to include the baroque violin as the other instrument in the experiments, because I wanted the real-life performances that would derive from this research to be performed by my ensemble Celeritas, which consists of traverso and violin in its most basic form. I felt attracted to this duet formation due to its limited range, which would, I hoped, encourage me to delve into the kind of detailed timbral exploration that I consider to be one of the defining features of my music in general. For the performance Four Bites of Autumn, I decided to also include a viola da gamba, since it was to be substantially longer than the experiments and I felt that the duet formation might not provide enough variety. For this performance, I decided to also include 18th-century repertoire, apart from music that I would compose myself. I knew quite early on that I wanted to serve a few different small dishes during the experiments, and that each of these would have its own music. Initially, I thought about composing a miniature for each of these bites (a musical \\u2018bite\\u2019 of sorts), but I became increasingly interested in the idea of \\u2018modulating\\u2019 between one bite\\u00a0and the next. This would allow me to create a longer musical tension arc that would match not only the individual dishes, but also the overall structure of the meal, and would give the whole performance a greater sense of unity and focus. This in turn generated the question of how to cue the moments of eating to the audience so there would be as precise a synchronisation as possible between what they were eating and what they were hearing. I decided that the cue would be musical, as a visual or verbal one would have disrupted the flow I was aiming for. The cues for the two experiments and Four Bites of Autumn are described below, as is their musical importance within the overall structure of the pieces. Of particular importance in all the different pieces is the pitch D, and more specifically the pitch D4. This is the lowest note on the traverso and I consider it to be the foundation of its sound, with a full and rich tone that blends wonderfully with the same note on the baroque violin, either when played as an open string or as a stopped note on the G string. It is also a very stable pitch on my instrument in particular (a copy of a G.A. Rottenburgh traverso from the Br\\u00fcggen Collection, made in 2020 by Roberto Bando in The Hague), which I always use to tune with the violin. The music for the two experiments and Four Bites of Autumn generates from the note D for this reason. The rhythmical writing does in general fall into two categories. On the one hand, there are flexible sections that allow the performers to stretch them for as long as needed (depending, for instance, on how long the audience is taking to eat a particular dish). In these, the instruments are not exactly aligned with each other, and there is either no pulse or each instrument follows a different pulse. On the other hand, there are sections in which the different parts are exactly aligned, generally with a stable common pulse. The first type of writing is meant to convey a feeling of stasis without too much development in terms of intensity or affect, while the second type aims to be more teleological and develops the material towards the next section. In terms of interpretation, there might be small discrepancies between the scores and the recordings, which might be due to last-minute revisions or improvised additions. Being Early Music practitioners used to improvising ornaments, I considered that allowing myself and the other performers to add spontaneous little elements in these pieces would keep the performances fresh. Finally, before I get into the detailed analysis of all the music I composed as part of this research, I would like to reflect on the table I include below. Drawing it was one of the first things I did when I started thinking about composing for the traverso and baroque violin, and it gives an oversight of the different extended techniques (the ones I was interested in, at least) for each instrument. The blue circles represent sounds that I classified as \"equivalent\" between the two instruments, while the violet triangles represent combined sounds that I thought might be interesting to explore. This table was extremely useful when composing the music for the two experiments, as will be described later. It is also interesting because of the visual adjacency it establishes between the sounds of the two instruments (further discussed in the section Mediating elements during the creative process).\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1927615",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 2610px; width: 1010px; height: 389px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 34; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "2610px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "389px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nThe scores for all the pieces can be found in Appendix 2.

Crossmodal correspondences). The analysis below will mainly focus on how the music was composed to function as a coherent whole, rather than on how the match between food and music was conceived, which is discussed in the different sections within the chapter\\u00a0Mediating elements.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1927625",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 3095px; width: 1010px; height: 313px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 35; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "3095px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "313px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nCueWhen I began composing the music for this experiment, I started by defining the musical cue. I decided that pizzicato sounds from the violin would be a very recognisable sound for the audience to follow. To have particularly resonant pizzicati, I decided to use the open strings of the violin. However, since I was also going to use pizzicati for the musical material corresponding to saltiness and that was to be confined to the pitch space G4-F#5, I took the two lower strings of the violin up an octave by using octave harmonics instead of the regular open string. To decide what the flute should play during this cue, I checked the timbre table shown above to see what sounds would be compatible with the pizzicati of the violin, and decided to have long notes with flattement maintaining the lowest and highest notes of the violin utterance. I gave the cue a simple but characteristic rhythm so it would be easily recognisable.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1927631",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 3665px; width: 1010px; height: 389px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 36; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "3665px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "389px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nIntroductionThe idea of the Introduction was to present the four pitches of the musical cue while at the same time hinting at material that would be associated with specific basic tastes later on in the piece. Firstly, the pitch D is introduced in both instruments, then the G with the violin glissando, in what will constitute the musical material for the bitter taste. Immediately afterwards, the A is introduced as a partial of D in the harmonic glissando of the violin and then the whistle tones of the flute, both elements crystallising in the A harmonic of the violin. The flute plays an A5 with different articulations and lengths, hinting at the material corresponding to the acidic taste by playing one of them with flatterzunge. The remaining pitch, E, is then introduced by the flute, to be taken up by the violin in a harmonic double stop that will reappear later in the piece corresponding to the sweet taste. A traverso multiphonic is played within that double stop, which will also come back corresponding to the sweet taste. The cue is then played to indicate to the audience that they can start eating the first dish.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1927673",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 4255px; width: 1010px; height: 410px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 37; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "4255px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "410px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nDish 1The musical material corresponding to the four basic tastes is introduced (a more detailed description of this can be found in the chapter Mediating elements.

The colours used in the score were initially chosen arbitrarily to make the reading easier for the performers, but happen to coincide with the crossmodal correspondences between colours and basic tastes pointed out in several studies (see Spence & Levitan, 2021).The proportion between the amounts of time that each musical material occupies within this section is similar to the degree of presence of their corresponding basic taste within the dish (more details on this can be found in the section Mediating elements. Structure).Since both the acidic and bitter tastes correspond with dissonant harmonic and melodic intervals, and the presence of these two tastes decreases from dish to dish, I decided to start with a fully chromatic selection of pitches that gradually become more diatonic.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1927684",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 4720px; width: 1010px; height: 320px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 38; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "4720px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "320px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nInterlude 1-2\\nThe bitter material appears in the violin one last time and becomes a harmonic double stop, corresponding to the sweet taste, a change that represents the decrease in bitterness and increase in sweetness of the second dish with respect to the first.

Short fragments of the musical material corresponding to acidity and saltiness are still present, but much less prominent than the ones corresponding to sweetness.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1927689",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 5670px; width: 1010px; height: 1095px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 40; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "5670px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "1095px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nEndingThe flute and violin gradually crystallise in a single high E.\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nExperiment 2\\n\\u00a0\\nFor the second experiment, I decided to focus on the semantic matching of music and food based on texture words. That is, I chose particular words that could describe both musical and culinary texture, and then paired food and music that could be described by the same texture word (more details about this can be found in the chapter Mediating elements. Semantic matching).The colours in the score were chosen arbitrarily to facilitate its reading. The salmon coloured squares represent the beginning of a new section, the violet notes represent the musical cue, and the blue texts signal where to find the instructions of what to do when the audience finishes eating each of the dishes.For this experiment, I decided to have the performers playing back to back, the audience sitting in a circle around them. The music allows for great flexibility so that the players can react to the setting and to each other without having to worry about being exactly together at any given time. This translated itself into rather lengthy verbal instructions in the score, which make for a less intuitive reading. However, this allowed us to memorise the instructions and, when performing, to only focus on the few notes that are written on the score, and on the coloured words as indications of when to move on to the next section. In the analysis, I included fewer examples from the score, as these are not easy to relate to the auditory result, which is what is most relevant here.The music in this experiment takes into account the comments of the audience about the disturbance caused by their chewing sounds during the first experiment. The foam, which required no chewing, was matched with music with no stable pulse. The chip created a loud crunch in the first bite, a less loud one in the second, etc., which was matched with repeating gestures in diminuendo that start creating the feeling of a pulse. Finally, the paratha required more constant chewing, which was matched with a continuous pulse in the violin part. The sounds of this chewing were meant to interact with the music and become yet another layer of it. I would recommend to anyone trying something similar to inform the audience first about the fact that they should embrace the sounds they make when chewing, and accept them as part of the music, as even in this experiment some audience members mentioned that their experience of the music had been disturbed by their own chewing sounds.I made the transitions in this experiment longer than those in the first, as a reaction to comments from the audience in this respect.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1930542",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 7450px; width: 1010px; height: 315px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 70; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "7450px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "315px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nIntroductionThe violin introduces the 'airy' D harmonic that will be suspended throughout the Foam part.

Firstly, because the length of the performance (about 45 minutes of music in total), which would have implied an enormous effort if I had had to compose all the music myself. Secondly, because I wanted to experiment with how I could apply the insights gained from the experiments to already existing music. Thirdly, since the performance was going to take place in the miller\\u2019s house of the windmill De Roos, which was finished in the mid-18th century, it seemed appropriate to have music from that time.\\nThe 18th-century pieces chosen were:\\nPietro Locatelli (born 1695 in Bergamo, Italy- died 1764 in Amsterdam, Netherlands)Trio sonata for flute, violin, and , Op. 5 No. 1 (published in Amsterdam in 1736)- Andante- Largo Andante- Allegro\\n\\nAlbertus Groneman (born 1711 in Hamm, Germany- died 1778 in Den Haag, Netherlands)Trio sonata for flute, violin, and basso continuo, Op. 2 No. 6\\u00a0- Adagio- Tempo di minuetto\\n\\nArcangelo Corelli (born 1653 in Fusignano, Italy- died 1713 in Rome, Italy)Concerto Grosso Op. 6 No. 9 (published in Amsterdam by Estienne Roger in 1714)- Preludio Largo- Allemanda Allegro- Corrente Vivace- Gavotta.

This meant that I would have to accommodate my musical language to that of the other pieces to some extent. I had already done something similar in A Year in Four Bites, the first performance I ever gave with a food and music pairing, for which I created pandiatonic soundscapes, the harmonies of which gradually melted into tonal patterns. For Four Bites of Autumn, I decided to start out with such soundscapes, then simplifying them towards the three pitches that would form the cue. The last chord of the cue would then be understood in the key of the next 18th-century piece and would lead to a small chorale that would act as a tonal prelude.Only my preludes are analysed here, as an analysis of the 18th-century pieces would exceed the scope and focus of this research (some comments pertaining to the choice of 18th-century pieces are given in the chapters Mediating elements. Semantic matching and Mediating elements. Narrative).\\n\\nCueAs in the first experiment, I took the cue in this performance as an important generative element. I decided that it would be formed by the three pitches E, A, and D, the three common notes between the scales of G major, B minor, D major, F major, D minor, and A major, the keys of all the 18th-century pieces that would be played. The feeling of a chord with a suspension that these three notes give when played together in whatever disposition allowed me to treat them as a functional chord within the context of each of the previously mentioned keys. At the same time, they are not characteristic enough as a tonal chord to make a non-tonal arrival to them sound striking. How I resolved this chord in different ways can be seen and heard in the musical examples featured during the analysis.\\n\\nPrelude to Dish 1The beginning is meant to generate the chord that will form the musical cue. Everyone starts on a D4, a common pitch to all the instruments, from which the other pitches from the cue, E and A, emerge,The last note of the the cue in the flute part (E) is held, the gamba adds a D and finally the violin adds the A in a new configuration of the three pitches. The violin changes to a G, identifying the chord as a 4/2 (in basso continuo notation), which resolves in a stepwise descending bass motion to a 6 chord, a gesture that is spun out in a typical 18th-century \"moto del basso\". A three-part chorale functions as a tonal prelude to the trio sonata by Locatelli.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1931196",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 12200px; width: 1010px; height: 205px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 79; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "12200px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "205px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nPrelude to Dish 2\\nThe prelude starts with a pandiatonic soundscape with the notes of G major, which gradually become reduced to the notes of the cue.

It becomes a pizzicato arpeggiated prelude in D minor.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1931207",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 13865px; width: 1010px; height: 390px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 82; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "13865px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "390px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nPrelude to Dish 4 (version for traverso and violin)\\nGiven the long time that passed between the previous dish and this one during the performance (we moved to a different room for this part), I did not consider it necessary to start in the previous key. Therefore, the prelude begins directly in a pandiatonic texture in A major. After the violin introduces an arpeggiated A major chord, somewhat hidden by the dissonances the flute plays against it, a progression begins in which the violin plays double stops with slowly ascending glissandi, and the flute expands on the triadic arpeggio idea of the violin. The two instruments end on a new chordal constellation of the three notes of the cue.The cue is presented in a duet version, an octave higher than previously. The chorale-like prelude is presented with a bariolage accompaniment from the violin, given the fact that the Pr\\u00e9lude from the De la Barre suite it introduces is already a slowly moving piece, and I thought that a bit more movement would be a welcome addition to introduce it.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1965234",                "style": "left: 170px; top: 14485px; width: 251px; height: 50px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 4; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "170px",                    "14485px"                ],                "size": [                    "251px",                    "50px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nReturn to homepage\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1927795",                "style": "left: 175px; top: 6960px; width: 1010px; height: 370px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 69; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "175px",                    "6960px"                ],                "size": [                    "1010px",                    "370px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nCueIn this experiment, I decided to use an extremely simple cue, two pizzicato notes played on open strings from the violin. I decided for this simplicity because I did not want the cue to interrupt the gradual transitions between textures, and orchestrating a melodic fragment in different ways depending on the moment of the piece did not appear to be a good solution, as it would have been less recognisable. Since pizzicato would not be used anywhere else in the piece, I decided that it would be recognisable enough. While this was indeed the case, it did not feel like this cue had the same impact on the audience the more characteristic ones I wrote for the first experiment and Four Bites of Autumn had (this is further discussed in the section Mediating elements. Ritual). It was more apologetic in the sense that the texture that was sounding continued under it, instead of taking a moment to just state the cue, which would have integrated it in the music more. In other words, I would recommend to make such a cue an indispensable part of the music.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-1931236",                "style": "left: 215px; top: 12605px; width: 500px; height: 41px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; z-index: 61; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "215px",                    "12605px"                ],                "size": [                    "500px",                    "41px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nFour Bites of Autumn.

This action, simple enough, had something momentous about it. Two days later, the substance in the jar looked basically the same, except for a couple of tiny bubbles I was able to spot through the glass. I discarded most of it, not without a pang of regret at the act of wasting food, and mixed the remainder with some more water and flour. Again, two days passed, and by then, the substance had transformed into something rather different. It had risen, and trapped in it were thousands of bubbles of gas, large and small. It had a not-so-subtle but nevertheless pleasant aroma of yeast and yogurt. I had succeeded in making a sourdough starter.\\nI started baking bread with it, a couple of loaves a week. After the first attempt, the result of which looked more like a thick pancake than a loaf of bread, there was, almost with every new bake, a growing sense of understanding and improvement. I had been reading Richard Sennett\\u2019s fascinating book\\u00a0The Craftsman (2008)\\u00a0and became aware that there were many similarities between the rhythms of my bread baking and those of my music making. Human skills are developed by following a series of stages: first, one ingrains a habit; then, the established habit is questioned, thereby expanding one's skill; and after this, the new skill needs to be ingrained as a new, better habit, so that it may be used with confidence and fluency. This process is cyclical, and creates a rhythm that is common to all crafts (Sennett, 2013, pp. 200-203). Thinking about my musical practice in this way, and having the clear example of a newly-acquired and quickly-developing craft, my bread baking, made my musical practice more effective and healthier, because my strive for perfection was replaced by a strive for more efficient habits, which could be questioned and improved as many times as needed.\\nDuring my bachelor studies in modern flute at the Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Tilburg (one of the departments of Fontys Hogeschool voor de Kunsten), I was informed that, as part of my graduation recital, I would have to design and carry out an interdisciplinary performance, in which two or more art forms would be combined. I decided to explore the parallels that I was finding between baking and cooking on the one hand and composing and playing music on the other. In April 2021, I premiered, together with Julia Hern\\u00e1ndez S\\u00e1nchez on the baroque violin and Alex Baker on the viola da gamba,\\u00a0A Year in Four Bites. The setting of this performance resembled, more or less, that of a concert, with the audience sitting in a semicircle around the musicians. However, each audience member received, at the beginning of the performance, a plate with four small dishes on it, which I had cooked using preserves that I had made during one entire year. The performance included\\u00a0not only\\u00a0musical and culinary elements, but also featured texts that were written and read by each of the musicians. At certain moments, the audience would be asked to eat one of the four dishes, which had been paired with a particular piece of music that I judged would suit it. I found the process of creating this performance, and in particular, of pairing the different musical and culinary 'bites', so interesting and enriching, that I decided to make this the topic of my master\\u2019s research.\\n\\nWriting like a gardener and the mental compost heap\\nAmerican science fiction and fantasy writer George R. R. Martin distinguishes two types of writers, namely architects and gardeners\\u00a0(2022). The former type has everything clearly laid out from the beginning, the latter sows a seed, waters it, observes the plant that grows, and then supports its growth by fertilising it, pruning it, tying it to a trellis, or simply letting it be. The form in which this research was conceived and developed has taken a bit of both approaches. At its outset, I was an architect, and I created a very clear structure, with a central axis consisting of two experimental performances around which the whole of the research would orbit. However, I envisioned for this structure to act like the perimeter of a garden, within and on which there would be space for ideas to sprout, and then grow, blossom, and fruit (and, every now and then, perish before doing any of the previous).\\u00a0Another science fiction and fantasy writer, Neil Gaiman, speaks about having a mental compost heap, a place in which observations from everyday life can come together and decompose, melt into each other and become, after a while, ideas\\u00a0(2020). I decided that this research-garden would need its very own compost heap, and on it I tossed all my knowledge about composing and performing music, cooking, and everything else that I thought might add to the fertility of my garden's soil. Bringing together concepts and techniques from different domains in this way allowed me to establish adjacency between these ideas, the first step to an intuitive leap\\u00a0(Sennett, 2008, 209-212). (Adjacency is discussed in more depth in the section\\u00a0Mediating elements during the creative process.)\\n\\nApproach and relevance\\nThis research addresses the issue of how to pair music and food from an artistic perspective. While I have used scientific knowledge to design some of the characteristics of the experimental performances I have carried out, my purpose was not to prove or disprove any particular hypothesis, but rather to see how that scientific knowledge could be applied in an artistic context. I consider this thesis relevant for precisely this reason. My hope is that it will provide artists with the tools and methods I would have wished to have when I began to investigate this issue.\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nHow to read this thesisThe reader should feel free to read this thesis in a non-linear way, following the hyperlinks that will lead them through different chapters and sections when pursuing a particular line of thought.

Particularly important in this sense is the work that has been, and is being, carried out by the Crossmodal Research Laboratory of the University of Oxford, led by Professor Charles Spence. \\nFor this thesis, literature concerning 'sonic seasoning' (that is, \"the deliberate matching, or pairing, of sound/music with taste/flavour in order to enhance, or modify, the multisensory tasting experience\" [Spence et al., 2021, p. 1]) has been particularly relevant. Sonic seasoning strongly relies on so-called 'crossmodal-correspondences', which are described as \"consistent mappings between attributes or dimensions of stimuli (i.e., objects or events) either physically present (or else merely imagined) in different sensory modalities, be they redundant (i.e., referring to the same stimulus attribute) or not\" (Kn\\u00f6ferle & Spence, 2012, p. 992). The reader interested in these topics is recommended to consult the review article published by Kn\\u00f6ferle & Spence (2012)\\u00a0on crossmodal correspondences between flavour/taste and music/sound; and the review article published by Spence et al. (2021) on sonic seasoning.\\u00a0\\nWhile the previously-mentioned body of literature has been of critical relevance for this research, I quickly found that 'sonic seasoning' was perhaps not the best way of describing the kind of relationship between flavour and sound that I was hoping to establish with my experiments and performances. The emphasis of sonic seasoning, as can be read above and is obvious from the fact that the type of matching described is called 'seasoning', is on the tasting experience, which is to be enhanced or modified by the music. A particularly interesting example of sonic seasoning are the American composer Ben Houge's 'Food Operas'. Using his expertise in composing soundtracks for video games, Houge has applied a similar type of thinking to the fine dining experience (Houge & Friedrichs, 2013, p. 2), achieving a very sophisticated synchronisation between the meal and its accompanying music. However, this type of experience is, according to Houge, incompatible with the presence of live music (2012).\\u00a0\\nOne example of a performance with live music paired to a certain food is the very popular piece 'Symphonic Chocolates' by Canadian composer Maxime Goulet. The composition, which exists in versions for symphony orchestra, string orchestra, wind orchestra, string quartet, and various other combinations of instruments, is a suite in four movements, each of them corresponding to a particular type of chocolate (caramel, dark, mint, and coffee-infused, respectively) that is eaten by the audience while that movement is played (Goulet, 2017). The piece seems to have been composed following a similar procedure to what I decided to do for Experiment 1 in this research, namely using studies on crossmodal correspondences between basic tastes and different sonic parameters to outline certain characteristics of the music that would match the different chocolates\\u00a0(Brouillette, 2018). Goulet's composition, which has been performed by many orchestras in the American continent and Europe, seems to take the opposite approach to sonic seasoning. Rather, a basically standard classical music concert is 'seasoned' with the presence of food.\\nOne example of sonic seasoning including a live music performance would be the wine tasting event that ocurred as a follow-up to a paper on crossmodal correspondences between classical music and wine published by Spence et al. (2013). In this private event,\\u00a0a group of players of the London Symphony Orchestra performed a number of pieces live while an audience of more than 100 people tasted the wines that had been judged to best correspond to these pieces (Spence et al., 2013, p. 4).\\u00a0\\nAs far as artistic research is concerned, the article published by Thompson-Bell et al. (2021) is particularly relevant, as it proposes a theoretical model for multisensory artistic practices. This model has not been adopted in the conception of this research and the performances linked to it as it clearly establishes a hierarchy between the two sensory domains that are to be combined, definining one primary domain that is to be sensorially extended through a secondary one (Thompson-Bell et al., 2021, pp. 243-245), but other artists might find it extremely useful. The work of these researchers has lead to instances of sonic seasoning through their collective 'Unusual ingredients'.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-2129596",                "style": "padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "0px",                    "0px"                ],                "size": [                    "330.664px",                    "40px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nReturn to homepage\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-2129597",                "style": "padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "0px",                    "0px"                ],                "size": [                    "330.664px",                    "40px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\nNext chapter: The food\\n\\n"            }        ],        "2130572": [            {                "id": "tool-2130575",                "style": "padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; border-radius: 0px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px; background-position: left top; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; transform: rotate(0deg);",                "position": [                    "0px",                    "0px"                ],                "size": [                    "1012px",                    "2334.5px"                ],                "rotation": "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)",                "content": "\\n\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nTo sign this thesis with my own name is only partly accurate, since writing it has only been possible thanks to the help and generosity of more than a few teachers, colleagues, friends, family members, and institutions.

What I can say is that I have certainly gained a better understanding of the elements that might help establish such synergy. The most important conclusion I have come to is that, in order to create a truly coherent performance including a food and music pairing, it is essential that one focuses not only on the pairing itself (whether using crossmodal correspondences, semantic matching, or a different tool), but on the performance as a whole. Analysing it in terms of its different components (audience, space, performers, food, music\\u2026), and the mediating elements between them is an approach I have found extremely helpful, and one I will continue exploring and refining in the future. Whether the relationship between the components of a performance is synergistic, additive, or antagonistic depends in great measure on the elements that mediate it, and on the relationships that are, in turn, established between those mediating elements themselves. A great crossmodal match might be made virtually inoperative if woven into the wrong narrative, a basic structural design might acquire great meaning and power if imbued with the dramatic expression of ritual. The list of mediating elements I have given in this research is of course not fixed, nor does it intend to be comprehensive, and it might be reduced, expanded, and redefined as the needs of the artist require it.\\nIn order to bring both food and music to a more or less similar level of importance within the performance, one might design a setting incorporating characteristic features of the respective original settings of these two domains. These features can then be rearranged in a way that might remind the guest of both, making a new, unfamiliar setting feel comfortable by drawing on the familiarity its constituting parts instil. Such a hybrid setting was used during Four Bites of Autumn. The small dining room of a caf\\u00e9 was rearranged, and chairs and tables were ordered so that the guests would be facing the musicians, who played in one of the corners of the room. This setting provided the general context of an eating occasion, but clearly focused the attention of the guests on the musicians. As a consequence, audience members felt free to share comments with each other while the musicians were not playing, but while there was music, silence was generally maintained, creating a kind of focus that is usual when listening to music in a concert, but rather unusual in our eating culture. This type of focus while eating was appreciated by several audience members during the experiments, who mentioned chewing slower than they normally would have, and experiencing more intense flavours than they were used to. The setting used during Experiment 2, in which the audience sat in a circle around the performers, who played back to back, created a similar hybrid feeling between eating occasion (sitting around a large table for a meal) and concert, and proved to be a very effective way of creating this sensation when the performance space is not originally intended for eating. Both of these formats proved to be successful settings, which invited to rethink and renew the rituals of the concert hall, creating a new type of performance with a greater sense of connection between the members of the audience, and between the audience and the performers.\\nThe fact of designing and composing both the food and the music for the experiments myself was interesting because of the extremely high degree of control it gave me over the final product, and because of the parallels between the two domains that I could establish during the creative process. However, working together with the caf\\u00e9 Bij de Roos for Four Bites of Autumn made the advantages of such a collaboration clear: it freed me from most of the logistics that the presence of food in the performance implied, it provided the perfect location, and it allowed for an artistic product that was richer because of the fact that more than one mind had worked on it.\\u00a0\\nSpence et al. point to the danger that \\u201cin the pursuit of the performance, the scientific insights and underpinnings may be lost in the creative process\\u201d (2021, p. 16). My recommendation to future artists in this field is that they very carefully study the research that has been done in the field of crossmodal correspondences and sonic seasoning and that, if they have the chance, work together with a crossmodal scientist during the design of their performances. However, I would also argue that, while research in this field is very relevant and should definitely inform their creative output, this information should be used to create the sort of constraint that spurs creativity, and not the sort that paralyses it. My experience of creating Experiment 1 almost exclusively basing the food and music pairing on studies about crossmodal correspondences was a rather frustrating one, and its result was, in my view, somewhat stale. Other mediating elements, such as narrative and ritual, should not be dismissed. A performance informed by the existing scientific knowledge about crossmodal correspondences, but nurtured by other elements that might make the artist feel like they are giving the best of themselves, will undoubtedly result in a richer and more enjoyable experience for both artist and audience, while respecting the work of the scientists in this field.\\nReflecting on the use of preexisting music as part of a crossmodal matching, I would argue that it is definitely possible, though perhaps the mediating elements that should be taken into account should be slightly different than those one would use if using music specifically composed for the occasion. One can easily write music that features certain musical parameters determined by crossmodal correspondences with the basic tastes of the food, or by words describing texture if a semantic matching is designed, but already composed music will rarely fit in these parameters as neatly. Instead, one might have to design the narrative around the pairing more carefully, or to think in terms of affect when designing the semantic matching. It is also possible to combine both preexisting music and music composed specifically for the occasion. For instance, the latter might be used to introduce those musical characteristics one would like to emphasise in the already existing piece.\\nFuture research might focus on further exploring the different mediating elements that have been described in this thesis, on studying the relationships that might be established between them, and on describing other potential mediating elements that have not been mentioned here. It would also be interesting to focus on exploring the temporal evolution of flavour and music, especially for artistic research in this field, since this undertaking would imply a creative investment unlikely to occur in research that is preoccupied with optimising the match between music and flavour/taste (Spence et al., 2021, p. 15).\\u00a0Another potential avenue for future research would be that of using semantic matching to make challenging works of art more understandable to the audience by providing an element which, through a different sensory modality, emphasises a particular aspect of these works.\\nLastly, I would like to share a more personal conclusion, related not so much to the research itself, but to the research question and its function. The purpose of the research question is to illuminate the path that is the enquiry and I found that, in order to do that effectively, it sometimes needs to change. The approach of letting this research grow like the herbs, shrubs, and trees in a garden also meant that, occasionally, exactly what I was doing became clear only as I was doing it. The research question would help me determine that it was necessary for me to take on a specific task at a given moment. But as I was carrying out that task I would sometimes discover that the question I was trying to answer was no longer the one that had driven me to work on it in the first place. It took me a while to realise that the research question itself was but one more plant in this research-garden, one that needed regular trimming to grow healthily.\\n\\n"            },            {                "id": "tool-2130664",                "style": "padding: 0px;
